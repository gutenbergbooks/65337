<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Although</span> the age of Justinian is the most interesting
and important in the whole series of the Byzantine
annals, no comprehensive work has hitherto been devoted to
the subject. The valuable and erudite “Vita Justiniani” of
Ludewig is more of a law book than of a biography, and less
of a circumstantial history than of either. The somewhat
strange medley published by Isambert under the title “Vie
de Justinien” is scarcely a complete chronology of the events,
and might be called a manual of the sources rather than a
history of the times.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Excellent accounts, however, of Justinian
are to be found in some general histories of the Byzantine
Empire as well as in several biographical dictionaries, whilst
monographs of greater or lesser extent exist under the names
of Perrinus, Invernizi, and Padovani, etc., but any student
of the period would decide that it deserves to be treated at
much greater length than has been devoted to it in any of
these books. In the present work the design has been to
place before the reader not only a record of events, but a
presentment of the people amongst whom, and of the stage
upon which those events occurred. I have also attempted
to correlate the aspects of the ancient and the modern
world in relation to science and progress.</p>

<p>This work has now been carefully revised and slightly
enlarged. I am indebted to suggestions from various
reviewers of the first edition for several of the improvements
introduced. Occasionally, however, they are in error and at
variance among themselves on some of the points noted. A
few of my critics have accused me of being too discursive,
especially in my notes, an impression which is the natural
result of my not having expressed it definitely anywhere that
my object was to present not merely the sociology and events
of a particular period, but also to illustrate, in an abridged
sense, the history of all time.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> birth and death of worlds are ephemeral events
in a cycle of astronomical time. In the life history of
a stellar system, of a planet, of an animal, parallel periods
of origin, exuberance, and of extinction are exhibited to our
experience, or to our understanding. Man, in his material
existence confined to a point, by continuity of effort and
perpetuity of thought, becomes coequal and coextensive with
the infinities of time and space. The intellectual store of
ages has evolved the supremacy of the human race, but the
zenith of its ascendancy may still be far off, and the aspiration
after progress has been entailed on the heirs of all
preceding generations. The advancement of humanity is the
sum of the progress of its component members, and the individual
who raises his own life to the highest attainable
eminence becomes a factor in the elevation of the whole
race. Familiarity with history dispels the darkness of the
past, which is so prolific in the myths that feed credulity
and foster superstition, the frequent parents of the most
stubborn obstacles which have lain in the path of progress.
The history of the past comprises the lessons of the future;
and the successes and failures of former times are a pre-vision
of the struggles to come and the errors to be avoided.
The stream of human life having once issued from its
sources, may be equal in endurance to a planet, to a stellar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x"> x</span>
system, or even to the universe itself. The mind of the universe
may be man, who may be the confluence of universal
intelligence. The eternity of the past, the infinity of the
present, may be peopled with races like our own, but whether
they die out with the worlds they occupy, or enjoy a perpetual
existence, transcends the present limits of our knowledge.
From century to century the solid ground of science
gains on the illimitable ocean of the unknown, but we are
ignorant as to whether we exist in the dawn or in the noonday
of enlightenment. The conceptions of one age become
the achievements of the next; and the philosopher may
question whether this world be not some remote, unaffiliated
tract, which remains to be annexed to the empire of universal
civilization. The discoveries of the future may be as
undreamt of as those of the past,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and the ultimate destiny
of our race is hidden from existing generations.</p>

<p>In the period I have chosen to bring before the reader,
civilization was on the decline, and progress imperceptible,
but the germs of a riper growth were still existent, concealed
within the spreading darkness of mediaevalism. When
Grecian science and philosophy seemed to stand on the
threshold of modern enlightenment the pall of despotism
and superstition descended on the earth and stifled every
impulse of progress for more than fifteen centuries. The
Yggdrasil of Christian superstition spread its roots throughout
the Roman Empire, strangling alike the nascent ethics
of Christendom, and the germinating science of the ancient
world. Had the leading minds of that epoch, instead of expending
their zeal and acumen on theological inanities,
applied themselves to the study of nature, they might have
forestalled the march of the centuries, and advanced us a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi"> xi</span>
thousand years beyond the present time. But the atmosphere
of the period was charged with a metaphysical mysticism
whereby all philosophic thought and material research were
arrested. The records of a millennium comprise little more
than the rise, the progress, and the triumph of superstition
and barbarism. The degenerate Greeks became the serfs
and slaves of the land in which they were formerly the
masters, and retreated gradually to a vanishing point in the
vast district from the Adriatic to the Indus, over which the
eagle-wing of Alexander had swept in uninterrupted conquest.
Unable to oppose their political solidarity and martial
science to the fanaticism of the half-armed Saracens, they
yielded up to them insensibly their faith and their empire,
and their place was filled by a host of unprogressive Mohammedans,
who brought with them a newer religion more
sensuous in its conceptions, but less gross in its practice,
than the Christianity of that day. But the hardy barbarians
of the North, drinking at the fountain of knowledge, had
achieved some political organization, and became the natural
and irresistible barriers against which the waves of Moslem
enthusiasm dashed themselves in vain. The term of Asiatic
encroachment was fixed at the Pyrenees in the west, and at
the Danube in the east by the valorous Franks and Hungarians;
and on the brink of the turning tide stand the heroic
figures of Charles Martel and Matthias Corvinus. Civilization
has now included almost the whole globe in its comprehensive
embrace; both the old world and the new have
been overrun by the intellectual heirs of the Greeks; in
every land the extinction of retrograde races proceeds with
measured certainty, and we appear to be safer from a returning
flood of barbarism than from some astronomical
catastrophe. The mediaeval order of things is reversed, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii"> xii</span>
ravages of Attila reappear under a new aspect, and the descendants
of the Han and the Hun alike are raised by the
hand, or crushed under the foot of aggressive civilization.</p>

<p>In the infancy of human reason intelligence outstrips
knowledge, and the mature, but vacant, mind soon loses itself
in the dark and trackless wilderness of natural phenomena.
An imaginative system of cosmogony, baseless as the fabric
of a dream, is the creation of a moment; to dissipate it the
work of ages in study and investigation. Less than a century
ago philosophic scepticism could only vent itself in a sneer
at the credibility of a tradition, or the fidelity of a manuscript;
and the folklore of peasants, encrusted with the hoar
of antiquity, was accepted by erudite mystics as the solution
of cosmogony and the proof of our communion with the
supernatural. An illegible line, a misinterpreted phrase, a
suspected interpolation, in some decaying document, the
proof or the refutation, was often hailed triumphantly by
ardent disputants as announcing the establishment or the
overthrow of revelation. But the most signal achievements
of historic research or criticism were powerless to elucidate
the mysteries of the universe; and the inquirer had to fall
back perpetually on the current mythology for the interpretation
of his objective environment. In the hands of science
alone were the keys which could unlock the book of nature,
and open the gates of knowledge as to the enigmas of visible
life. A flood of light has been thrown on the order of natural
phenomena, our vision has been prolonged from the dawn of
history to the dawn of terrestrial life, an intelligible hypothesis
of existence has been deduced from observation and
experiment, idealism and dogma have been recognized as
the offspring of phantasy and fallacy, and the mystical elements
of Christianity have been dismissed by philosophy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii"> xiii</span>
that limbo of folly which long ago engulfed the theogonies
of Greece and Rome. The sapless trunk of revelation lies
rotting on the ground, but the undiscerning masses, too
credulous to inquire, too careless to think, have allowed it
to become invested with the weeds of superstition and ignorance;
and the progeny of hierophants, who once sheltered
beneath the green and flourishing tree, still find a cover in
the rank growth. In the turn of the ages we are confronted
by new Pagans who adhere to an obsolete religion; and the
philosopher can only hope for an era when every one will
have sufficient sense and science to think according to the
laws of nature and civilization.</p>

<p>The history of the disintegrating and moribund Byzantine
Empire has been explored by modern scholars with untiring
assiduity; and the exposition of that debased political system
will always reflect more credit on their brilliant researches
than on the chequered annals of mankind.</p>

anchorage for shipping, it might become the centre of
empire and commerce for the whole Eastern hemisphere.
Yet, owing to an adverse fate, the full realization of this
splendid conception remains a problem of the future.
Byzantium as an independent city was little more than an
outpost of civilization; as a provincial town of the Roman
Empire its political position allowed it no scope for development;
as the metropolis of the same Empire in its age of
decadence its fitful splendour is an unsubstantial pageant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2"> 2</span>
without moral or political stability. Lastly, in the hands of
the Turk its growth has been fettered by the prejudices of a
nation unable to free itself from the bondage of an effete
civilization.</p>


<h3 id="section_I">I. <span class="smcap">History</span></h3>

<p>The first peopling of the site of Constantinople is a question
in prehistoric research, which has not yet been elucidated
by the palaeontologist. Unlike the Roman area, no relics of
an age of stone or bronze have been discovered here;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> do
not, perhaps, exist, but doubtless the opportunities, if not the
men, have been wanting for such investigations.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> That the
region seemed to the primitive Greeks to be a wild and
desolate one, we learn from the tradition of the Argonautic
expedition;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the epithet of “Axine,”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> or inhospitable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3"> 3</span>
applied in the earliest times to the Euxine or Black Sea. By
the beginning, however, of the seventh century before the
Christian era these seas and maritime channels had been
explored, and several colonies<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> had been planted by the
adventurous Greeks who issued from the Ionian seaport of
Miletus. Later than the Milesians, a band of Dorians from
Megara penetrated into these parts and, by a strange choice,
as it was afterwards considered, selected a point at the mouth
of the Bosphorus on the Asiatic shore for a settlement, which
they called Chalcedon.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Seventeen years later<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> a second
party from Megara fixed themselves on the European headland,
previously known as Lygos,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> nearly opposite their first
colony. The leader of this expedition was Byzas,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and from
him the town they built was named Byzantium.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4"> 4</span>
limits of the original city are now quite unknown, but doubtless
they were small at first and were gradually extended
according as the community increased in wealth and prosperity.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
During the classic period of Greek history the town
rose to considerable importance, as its commanding position
enabled it to impose a toll on ships sailing to and from the
Euxine sea; a power of which, however, it made a very
sparing use.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It was also enriched by the countless shoals of
fish<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which, when the north winds blew, descended from the
Euxine and thronged the narrow but elongated gulf called,
most probably for that reason, <i>Chrysoceras</i> or Golden Horn.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5"> 5</span>
Ultimately Byzantium became the largest city in Thrace,
having expanded itself over an area which measured four
and a half miles in circumference, including, probably, the
suburbs.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It exercised a suzerainty over Chalcedon and
Perinthus,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and reduced the aboriginal Bithynians to a state
of servitude comparable to that of the Spartan Helots.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Notwithstanding
its natural advantages, the town never won any
pre-eminence among the Hellenic communities, and nothing
more unstable than its political position is presented to us
in the restless concourse of Grecian nationalities. In the
wars of Persians with Greeks, and of Greeks with Greeks, it
always became the sport of the contending parties; and during
a century and a half (about 506 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to 350 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) it was
taken and re-taken at least six times by Medes, Spartans,
Athenians, and Thebans, a change of constitution following,
of course, each change of political connection.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In 340 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
however, the Byzantines, with the aid of the Athenians, withstood
a siege successfully, an occurrence the more remarkable
as they were attacked by the greatest general of the age,
Philip of Macedon. In the course of this beleaguerment, it
is related, on a certain wet and moonless night the enemy
attempted a surprise, but were foiled by reason of a bright
light which, appearing suddenly in the heavens, startled all
the dogs in the town and thus roused the garrison to a sense
of their danger.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> To commemorate this timely phenomenon,
which was attributed to Hecate, they erected a public statue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6"> 6</span>
to that goddess and, as it is supposed, assumed the crescent
for their chief national device. For several centuries after
this event the city enjoyed a nominal autonomy, but it
appears to have been in perpetual conflict with its civilized
or barbarous neighbours; and in 279 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> it was even laid
under tribute<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> by the horde of Gauls who penetrated into
Asia and established themselves permanently in Galatia.
After the appearance of the Roman legionaries in the East
the Byzantines were always the faithful friends of the Republic,
while it was engaged in suppressing the independent
potentates of Macedonia and Asia Minor. For its services
Byzantium was permitted to retain the rank of a free city,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and its claim to indulgence was allowed by more than one
of the Roman emperors,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> even after <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 70, when Vespasian
limited its rights to those of a provincial town.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Of all the ancient historians one only has left us a description
capable of giving some visual impression as to the
appearance of old Byzantium. “This city,” says Dion
Cassius,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> “is most favourably situated, being built upon an
eminence, which juts out into the sea. The waters, like a
torrent, rushing downwards from the Pontus impinge against
the promontory and flow partly to the right, so as to form
the bay and harbours, but the main stream runs swiftly
alongside the city into the Propontis. The town is also extremely
well fortified, for the wall is faced with great square
stones joined together by brazen clamps, and it is further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7"> 7</span>
strengthened on the inside through mounds and houses
being built up against it. This wall seems to consist of a
solid mass of stone,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and it has a covered gallery above,
which is very easily defended. On the outside there are
many large towers, perforated with frequent loopholes and
ranged in an irregular line, so that an attacking party is
surrounded by them and exposed on all sides at once.
Toward the land the fortifications are very lofty, but less so
on the side of the water, as the rocks on which they are
founded and the dangers of the Bosphorus render them
almost unassailable. There are two harbours within the
walls,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> guarded by chains, and at the ends of the moles
inclosing them towers facing each other make the passage
impracticable to an enemy. I have seen the walls standing
and have also heard them speaking; for there are seven
vocal towers stretching from the Thracian gates to the sea.
If one shouts or drops a pebble in the first it not only resounds
itself or repeats the syllables, but it transmits the
power for the next in order to do the same; and thus the
voice or echo is carried in regular succession through the
whole series.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>At the end of the second century the Byzantines were
afflicted by the severest trial which had ever come within
their experience. In the tripartite struggle between the
Emperor Severus and his competitors of Gaul and Asia, the
city unfortunately threw in its lot with Niger, the Proconsul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8"> 8</span>
of Syria. Niger soon fell, but Byzantium held out with inflexible
obstinacy for three years and, through the ingenuity
of an engineer named Priscus, defied all the efforts of the
victor. During this time the inhabitants suffered progressively
every kind of hardship and horror which has been put on
record in connection with sieges of the most desperate
character. Stones torn from the public buildings were used
as projectiles, statues of men and horses, in brass and marble,
were hurled on the heads of the besiegers, women gave their
hair to be twisted into cords and ropes, leather soaked in
water was eaten, and finally they fell on one another and fed
on human flesh. At last the city yielded, but Severus was
exasperated, and his impulse of hostility only ceased with the
destruction of the prize he had won at such a cost in blood
and treasure. The garrison and all who had borne any public
office, with the exception of Priscus, were put to death, the
chief buildings were razed,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> the municipality was abolished,
property was confiscated, and the town was given over to the
previously subject Perinthians, to be treated as a dependent
village. With immense labour the impregnable fortifications
were levelled with the ground, and the ruins of the first bulwark
of the Empire against the barbarians of Scythia attested
the wisdom and temperance of the master of the East and
West.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>But the memory of Byzantium dwelt in the mind of
Severus and he was attracted to revisit the spot. In cooler
moments he surveyed the wreck; the citizens, bearing olive
branches in their hands, approached him in a solemn and
suppliant procession; he determined to rebuild, and at his
mandate new edifices were reared to supply the place of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9"> 9</span>
those which had been ruined. He even purchased ground,
which had been previously occupied by private gardens, for
the laying out of a hippodrome,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> a public luxury with which
the town had never before been adorned. But the hateful
name of Byzantium was abolished and the new city was
called Antonina<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> by Severus, in honour of his eldest son;
a change, however, which scarcely survived the life of its
author. Through Caracalla,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> or some rational statesman acting
in the name of that reprobate, the city regained its political
privileges, but the fortifications were not restored, and for
more than half a century it remained defenceless against the
barbarians, and even against the turbulent soldiery of the
Empire. Beginning from about 250 the Goths ravaged the
vicinity of the Bosphorus and plundered most of the towns,
holding their own against Decius and several other short-lived
emperors. Under Gallienus a mutinous legion is said
to have massacred most of the inhabitants, but shortly afterwards
the same emperor gave a commission to two Byzantine
engineers to fortify the district, and henceforward Byzantium
again appears as a stronghold, which was made a centre of
operations against the Goths, in the repulse of whom the
natives and their generals even played an important part.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10"> 10</span>
In 323 Licinius, the sole remaining rival of Constantine,
after his defeat in a great battle near Adrianople, took refuge
in Byzantium, and the town again became the scene of a
contest memorable in history, not for the magnitude of the
siege, but for the importance of the events which it inaugurated.
Licinius soon yielded, and a new era dawned for
Byzantium, which in a few years became lastingly known to
the nations as the City of Constantine.</p>

<p>The tongue of land on which Constantinople is built is
essentially a low mountainous ridge, rising on three sides by
irregular slopes from the sea. Trending almost directly eastward
from the continent of Europe, it terminates abruptly in a
rounded headland opposite the Asiatic shore, from which it
is separated by the entrance of the Bosphorus, at this point
a little more than a mile in width. This diminutive peninsula,
which is bounded on the north by the inland extension of
the Bosphorus, called the Golden Horn, and on the south
by the Propontis or Sea of Marmora, has a length of between
three and four miles. At its eastern extremity it is about a
mile broad and it gradually expands until, in the region
where it may be said to join the mainland, its measurement
has increased to more than four times that distance. The
unlevel nature of the ground and reminiscences of the seven
hills of classical Rome have always caused a parallel to be
drawn between the sites of the two capitals of the Empire,
but the resemblance is remote and the historic import of the
Roman hills is totally wanting in the case of those of Constantinople.
The hills of the elder city were mostly distinct
mounts, which had borne suggestive names in the earliest
annals of the district. Every citizen had learned to associate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11"> 11</span>
the Palatine with the Roma Quadrata of Romulus, the
Aventine with the ill-omened auspices of Remus, the Quirinal
with the rape of the Sabine women, the Esquiline with the
murder of King Servius, the Capitol with the repulse of the
Gauls by Manlius; and knew that when the standard was
raised on the Janiculum the comitia were assembled to
transact the business of the Republic. But the Byzantine
hills are little more than variations in the face of the slope
as it declines on each side from the central dorsum to the
water, and have always been nameless unless in the numerical
descriptions of the topographer. On the north five depressions
constitute as many valleys and give rise to six hills,
which are numbered in succession from the narrow end of
the promontory to the west. Thus the first hill is that on
which stood the acropolis of Byzantium. Two of the valleys,
the third and fifth, can be traced across the dorsum of the
peninsular from sea to sea. A rivulet, called the Lycus,
running from the mainland, joins the peninsula near its
centre and then turns in a south-easterly direction so as to
fall into the Propontis. The valley through which this stream
passes, the sixth, bounds the seventh hill, an elevation known
as the Xerolophos or Dry-mount, which, lying in the south-west,
occupies more than a third of the whole area comprised
within the city walls.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> From every high point of the promontory
the eye may range over seas and mountains often celebrated
in classic story—the Trojan Ida and Olympus, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12"> 12</span>
Hellespont, Athos and Olympus of Zeus, and the Thracian
Bosphorus embraced by wooded hills up to the “blue
Symplegades” and the Euxine, so suggestive of heroic tradition
to the Greek mind. The Golden Horn itself describes
a curve to the north-west of more than six miles in length,
and at its extremity, where it turns upon itself, becomes
fused with the estuary of two small rivers named Cydarus
and Barbyses.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Throughout the greater part of its course it
is about a quarter of a mile in width, but at one point below
its centre, it is dilated into a bay of nearly double that
capacity. This inlet was not formerly, in the same sense as
it is now, the port of Constantinople; to the ancients it was
still the sea, a moat on a large scale, which added the safety
of water to the mural defences of the city; and the small shipping
of the period was accommodated in artificial harbours
formed by excavations within the walls or by moles thrown
out from the shore.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The climate of this locality is very
changeable, exposed as it is to north winds chilled by transit
over the Russian steppes, and to warm breezes which
originate in the tropical expanses of Africa and Arabia.
The temperature may range through twenty degrees in a
single day, and winters of such arctic severity that the Golden
Horn and even the Bosphorus are seen covered with ice are
not unknown to the inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Variations of landscape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13"> 13</span>
due to vegetation are found chiefly in the abundance of
plane, pine, chestnut, and other trees, but more especially
of the cypress. Earthquakes are a permanent source of
annoyance, and have sometimes been very destructive. Such
in brief are the geographical features of this region, which
the caprice of a prince, in a higher degree, perhaps, than its
natural endowments, appointed to contain the metropolis of
the East.</p>

<p>When Constantine determined to supplant the ancient
capital on the Tiber by building a new city in a place of his
own choice,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> he does not appear to have been more acute in
discerning the advantages of Byzantium than were the first
colonists from Megara. It is said that Thessalonica first
fixed his attention; it is certain that he began to build in
the Troad, near the site of Homeric Ilios; and it is even
suggested that when he shifted his ground from thence he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14"> 14</span>
next commenced operations at Chalcedon.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> By 328,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> however,
he had come to a final decision, and Byzantium was
exalted to be the actual rival of Rome. This event, occurring
at so advanced a date and under the eye of civilization,
yet became a source of legend, so as to excel even in that
respect the original foundation by Byzas. The oracles had
long been lapsing into silence,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> but their place had been
gradually usurped by Christian visions, and every zealot who
thought upon the subject conceived of Constantine as acting
under a special inspiration from the Deity. More than a
score of writers in verse and prose have described the circumstances
under which he received the divine injunctions, and
some have presented to us in detail the person and words of
the beatific visitant.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> On the faith of an ecclesiastical historian<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
we are asked to believe that an angelic guide even
directed the Emperor as he marked out the boundaries of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15"> 15</span>
his future capital. When Constantine, on foot with a spear
in his hand, seemed to his ministers to move onwards for an
inordinate distance, one of them exclaimed: “How far, O
Master?” “Until he who precedes me stands,” was the
reply by which the inspired surveyor indicated that he
followed an unseen conductor. Whether Constantine was a
superstitious man is an indeterminate question, but that he
was a shrewd and politic one is self-evident from his career,
and, if we believe that he gave currency to this and similar
marvellous tales, we can perceive that he could not have
acted more judiciously with the view of gaining adherents
during the flush of early Christian enthusiasm.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The area of the city was more than quadrupled by the wall
of Constantine, which extended right across the peninsula in
the form of a bow, distant at the widest part about a mile
and three-quarters from the old fortifications.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> This space,
by comparison enormous, and which yet included only four
of the hills with part of the Xerolophos, was hastily filled
by the Emperor with buildings and adornments of every description.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16"> 16</span>
Many cities of the Empire, notably Rome, Athens,
Ephesus, and Antioch, were stripped of some of their most
precious objects of art for the embellishment of the new capital.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Wherever statues, sculptured columns, or metal castings
were to be found, there the agents of Constantine were busily
engaged in arranging for their transfer to the Bosphorus.
Resolved that no fanatic spirit should mar the cosmopolitan
expectation of his capital the princely architect subdued his
Christian zeal, and three temples<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> to mythological divinities
arose in regular conformity with pagan custom. Thus the
“Fortune of the City” took her place as the goddess Anthusa<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
in a handsome fane, and adherents of the old religion could
not declare that the ambitious foundation was begun under
unfavourable auspices. In another temple a statue of Rhea,
or Cybele, was erected in an abnormal posture, deprived of
her lions and with her hands raised as if in the act of praying
over the city. On this travesty of the mother of the Olympians,
we may conjecture, was founded the belief which prevailed
in a later age that the capital at its birth had been
dedicated to the Virgin.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> That a city permanently distinguished
by the presence of an Imperial court should remain
deficient in population is opposed to common experience of
the laws which govern the evolution of a metropolis. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17"> 17</span>
Constantine could not wait, and various artificial methods
were adopted in order to provide inhabitants for the vacant
inclosure. Patricians were induced to abandon Rome by
grants of lands and houses, and it is even said that several
were persuaded to settle at Constantinople by means of an
ingenious deception. Commanding the attendance in the
East of a number of senators during the Persian war, the
Emperor privately commissioned architects to build counterparts
of their Roman dwellings on the Golden Horn. To
these were transferred the families and households of the
absent ministers, who were then invited by Constantine to
meet him in his new capital. There they were conducted to
homes in which to their astonishment they seemed to revisit
Rome in a dream, and henceforth they became permanent
residents in obedience to a prince who urged his wishes with
such unanswerable arguments.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> As to the common herd we
have no precise information, but it is asserted by credible
authority that they were raked together from diverse parts,
the rabble of the Empire who derived their maintenance
from the founder and repaid him with servile adulation in
the streets and in the theatre.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>By the spring of 330<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> the works were sufficiently advanced
for the new capital to begin its political existence, and Constantine
decreed that a grand inaugural festival should take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18"> 18</span>
place on the 11th of May. The “Fortune of the City” was
consecrated by a pagan ceremony in which Praetextatus, a
priest, and Sopater, a philosopher, played the principal parts;<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
largess was distributed to the populace, and magnificent
games were exhibited in the Hippodrome, where the Emperor
presided, conspicuous with a costly diadem decked
with pearls and precious stones, which he wore for the first
time.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> On this occasion the celebration is said to have lasted
forty days,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and at the same time Constantine instituted the
permanent “Encaenia,” an annual commemoration, which
he enjoined on succeeding emperors for the same date. A
gilded statue of himself, bearing a figure of Anthusa in one
hand, was to be conducted round the city in a chariot, escorted
by a military guard, dressed in a definite attire,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and
carrying wax tapers in their hands. Finally, the procession
was to make the circuit of the Hippodrome and, when it
paused before the cathisma, the emperor was to descend from
his throne and adore the effigy.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> We are further told that an
astrologer named Valens was employed to draw the horoscope
of the city, with the result that he predicted for it an
existence of 696 years.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19"> 19</span></p>

<p>After the fall of Licinius it appears most probable that Constantine,
as a memorial of his accession to undivided power,
gave Byzantium the name of Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> When, however,
he transformed that town into a metropolis, in order to
express clearly the magnitude of his views as to the future,
he renamed it Second, or New Rome. At the same time he
endowed it with special privileges, known in the legal phraseology
of the period as the “right of Italy and prerogative
of Rome”;<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> and to keep these facts in the public eye he
had them inscribed on a stone pillar, which he set up in a
forum, or square, called the Strategium, adjacent to an
equestrian statue of himself.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> To render it in all respects the
image of Rome, Constantinople was provided with a Senate,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
a national council known only at that date in the artificial
form which owes its existence to despots. After his choice of
Byzantium for the eastern capital Constantine never dwelt
at Rome, and in all his acts seems to have aimed at extinguishing
the prestige of the old city by the grandeur of the
new one, a policy which he initiated so effectively that in
the century after his death the Roman Empire ceased to be
Roman.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20"> 20</span></p>

<p>Constantine is credited with the erection of many churches<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
in and around Constantinople, but, with the exception of
St. Irene,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> the Holy Cross,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and the Twelve Apostles,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> their
identification rests with late and untrustworthy writers. One,
St. Mocius,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> is said to have been built with the materials of
a temple of Zeus, which previously stood in the same place,
the summit of the Xerolophos, outside the walls. Another,
St. Mena, occupied the site of the temple of Poseidon
founded by Byzas.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Paganism was tolerated as a religion of
the Empire until the last decade of the fourth century, when
it was finally overthrown by the preponderance of Christianity.
Laws for its total suppression were enacted by
Theodosius I, destruction of temples was legalized, and at
the beginning of the fifth century it is probable that few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21"> 21</span>
traces remained of the sacred edifices which had adorned
old Byzantium.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>After the age of Constantine the progress of New Rome
as metropolis of the east was extremely rapid,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the suburbs
became densely populous, and in 413 Theodosius II gave a
commission to Anthemius,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the Praetorian Prefect, to build
a new wall in advance of the old one nearly a mile further
down the peninsula. The intramural space was thus increased
by an area more than equal to half its former
dimensions; and, with the exception of some small additions
on the Propontis and the Golden Horn, this wall
marked the utmost limit of Constantinople in ancient or
modern times. In 447 a series of earthquakes, which lasted
for three months, laid the greater part of the new wall in
ruins, fifty-seven of the towers, according to one account,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
having collapsed during the period of commotion. This was
the age of Attila and the Huns, to whom Theodosius, sooner
than offer a military resistance, had already agreed to pay an
annual tribute of seven hundred pounds of gold.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> With the
rumour that the barbarians were approaching the undefended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22"> 22</span>
capital the public alarm rose to fever-heat, and the Praetorian
Prefect of the time, Cyrus Constantine, by an extraordinary
effort, not only restored the fortifications of Anthemius, but
added externally a second wall on a smaller scale, together
with a wide and deep fosse,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> in the short space of sixty days.
To the modern observer it might appear incredible that such
a prodigious mass of masonry, extending over a distance of
four miles, could be reared within two months, but the fact
is attested by two inscriptions still existing on the gates,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> by
the Byzantine historians,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and by the practice of antiquity
in times of impending hostility.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<h3 id="section_II">II. <span class="smcap">Topography</span></h3>

<p>Having now traced the growth of the city on the Golden
Horn from its origin in the dawn of Grecian history until its
expansion into the capital of the greatest empire of the past,
I have reached the threshold of my actual task—to place
before the reader a picture of Constantinople at the beginning
of the sixth century in its topographical and sociological
aspects. The literary materials, though abundant, are
in great part unreliable and are often devoid of information
which would be found in the most unpretentious guide-book
of modern times.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> On the other hand the monumental remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24"> 24</span>
are unusually scanty, insignificant indeed compared
with those of Rome, and few cities, which have been continuously
occupied, have suffered so much during the lapse
of a few centuries as Constantinople. Political revolution
has been less destructive than that of religion, and Moslem
fanaticism, much more than time or war, has achieved the
ruin of the Christian capital. On this ground, the same
calamities which Christianity inflicted on paganism in the
fourth century, she suffered herself at the hands of Islam in
the fifteenth.</p>

<p>The modern visitor, who approaches Constantinople, is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25"> 25</span>
once impressed by the imposing vista of gilded domes and
minarets, which are the chief objective feature of the Ottoman
capital. It is scarcely necessary to say that in the sixth
century the minaret, uniquely characteristic as it is of a
Mohammedan city, would be absent, but the statement must
also be extended to the dome, the most distinctive element
in Byzantine architecture, which at the date of my description
scarcely yet existed even in the conception of the builder.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
If we draw near from the Sea of Marmora (the Propontis) at
the time of this history, we shall observe, extending by land
and sea from the southernmost point, the same ranges of
lofty walls and towers, now falling into universal ruin, but
then in a state of perfect repair. Within appear numerous
great houses and several tall columns interspersed among a
myriad of small red-roofed dwellings, densely packed; and
here and there the eye is caught by a gleam of gilded tiles
from the roof of a church or a palace. In order to inspect
the defences on the land side, the aspect of the city most
strongly fortified, we must disembark near the south-west
corner of the Xerolophos, the locality now known as the
Seven Towers. Without the city, towards the west, the
ground consists of flowery meadows diversified by fruit-gardens
and by groves of cypress and plane trees.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Almost
at the water’s edge is an imposing bastion, which from its
circular form is called the Cyclobion.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Proceeding inland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26"> 26</span>
we shall not at this date find a road winding over hill and
dale from sea to sea as at the present day.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Most of the
country is occupied by walled <i>philopatia</i> or pleasaunces in
which landscape gardening has been developed with considerable
art, suburban residences of the Byzantine aristocracy.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
In a grove about a mile from the shore we come
upon a certain well, which is regarded as sacred and frequented
by sufferers from various diseases on account of the
healing virtue attributed to its waters.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Northwards the
extramural district abutting on the Golden Horn is called
Blachernae from the chief of a Thracian tribe, which formerly
occupied this quarter.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Here, contiguous to the wall,
we may notice a small summer palace on two floors, built
of brick with rows of stone-framed, arched windows, now
undergoing restoration and extension by the Emperor Anastasius.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27"> 27</span>
A few paces further on is a Christian chapel
dedicated to the Theotokos or Mother of God, founded by
Pulcheria,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> the pious but imperious sister of Theodosius II,
and finally the maiden wife of the Emperor Marcian. Hard
by is a natural well,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> which from its interesting associations
is now beginning to ripen into sanctity.</p>

<p>The scheme of fortification consists of three main defences:
(1) a foss, (2) an outer wall with frequent towers, and (3) an
inner wall, similar, but of much greater proportions.</p>

<p>(1) Since the moat necessarily follows the trend of the
ground as it rises on either side from the beach to the dorsum
of the peninsula, this canal, instead of maintaining a uniform
level, consists of a number of sections divided by cross-walls,
the distances between which are determined by the
exigences of ascent or descent. In its course it outlines the
contour of the walls, which advance on the peninsula from
each end in the form of a bow. The average width of this
foss is about sixty, and its depth about thirty feet. It is
lined on both sides from the bottom with substantial stone
walls, but, whilst that on the outside only reaches the level
of the ground, the wall next the city, with a crenellated top,
rises for several feet,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> so as to convey the impression of a
triple wall of defence. In peace time the water is allowed
to run low, but if an assault is apprehended the trench can
be quickly flooded by means of earthenware pipes concealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28"> 28</span>
within the partition walls. From these conduits the city
also derives a secret supply of water not likely to be tampered
with by a besieging army.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>(2) At a distance of about twenty yards from the inner
edge of the moat, rising to a height of nearly thirty feet,
with dentated parapets, stands the lesser wall. Towers of
various shapes, square, round, and octagonal, project from
its external face at intervals of about fifty yards. Each tower
overtops the wall and possesses small front and lateral windows,
which overlook the level tract<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> stretching from the
foss. High up in each tower is a floorway having an exit on
the intramural space behind, and they have also steps outside
which lead to the roof. The vacant interval between the
walls is about fifty feet wide, usually called the <i>peribolos</i>.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> It
has been artificially raised to within a few feet of the top of
the wall by pouring into it the earth recovered in excavating
the moat.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> This is the special vantage-ground of the defenders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29"> 29</span>
of the city during a siege: from hence mainly they
launch their missiles against the enemy or engage them in a
hand-to-hand fight should they succeed in crossing the moat
and planting their scaling-ladders against the wall.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>(3) Bounding the <i>peribolos</i> posteriorly lies the main land-wall
of Constantinople, the great and indisputable work of
Theodosius II. In architectural configuration it is almost
similar to the outer wall, but its height is much greater, and
its towers, placed so as to alternate with the smaller ones in
front, occupy more than four times as much ground. Built
as separate structures, but adherent to the wall behind, they
rise above it and project forwards into the interspace for
more than half its breadth. Most of the towers are square,
but those of circular or octagonal shape are not infrequent.
In level places offering facilities for attack the wall has a
general height of seventy feet, but in less accessible situations,
on rising or rugged ground, it attains to little more
than half that elevation.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> As in the case of the outer defences,
the wall and towers are crested by an uninterrupted
series of crenellated battlements.</p>

<p>The towers are entered from the city at the back, and
within each one is a winding stone staircase leading to the
top. Here, sheltered by the parapet, there is room for sixty
or seventy men to assail an enemy with darts or engines of
war. There is also a lower floor from which a further body
of soldiers can act on the offensive by means of front and
side windows or loopholes. At intervals certain of the towers
have an exit on the <i>peribolos</i> for the use of those militants
who have their station on that rampart. In time of peace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30"> 30</span>
these towers serve as guard-houses, and the sentries are enjoined
to maintain their vigilance by passing the word of
each successive hour from post to post during the night.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
The usual thickness of this wall is about eight feet, but no
regular rampart has been prepared along the summit, the
defensive value of such an area being superseded by the
<i>peribolos</i>. Hence the top, the width of which is limited to
less than five feet by the encroachment of the parapet, has
no systematic means of access from the ground or from the
towers. Hewn stone, worked in the vicinity, has been used
for the construction of these fortifications,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and in some
places close to the city the ground may be seen to have
been quarried into hills and hollows<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> for the supply of the
builders.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31"> 31</span></p>

<p>At about every half mile of their length these walls are
pierced by main gateways for the passing to and fro of the
inhabitants. In these situations the inner wall is increased
to more than treble its ordinary thickness, and the passage
is flanked by a pair of the greater towers, which here approximate
at much less than their usual distance. The
thoroughfare consists of a deep and lofty archway, which on
occasion can be closed by ponderous doors revolving on
huge iron hinges. Opposite each gate the moat is crossed
by wooden drawbridges easily removable in case of a siege.
The most southerly entrance, being opposite the holy well,
is called the Gate of the Fountain; next comes the Gate of
Rhegium, then that of St. Romanus, fourthly the Charsios
or oblique Gate,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and lastly the Xylokerkos Gate—that of
the wooden circus. Between the third and fourth gates the
moat is deficient and the walls are tunnelled for the transit
of the streamlet Lycus, which, though almost dry in summer,
swells to a considerable volume in winter. The second and
last portals bear metrical inscriptions, differing verbally, but
each declaring the fact that the Prefect, Cyrus Constantine,
built the wall in two months.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> On the second gate, that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32"> 32</span>
Rhegium, the circumstance is recorded in a Latin tristich
as well as in a Greek distich.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Besides these popular approaches there is another series
of five gates, architecturally similar, but designed only for
military or strategic purposes. About intermediate in position
and in line with neither roads nor bridges, they are closed
to the general public and named merely in numerical succession
from south to north.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Just above the third gate, that
is, about half way between the Golden Horn and the Propontis,
the walls dip inwards for a distance of nearly one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33"> 33</span>
hundred yards, forming a crescent or, as the Greeks call it,
Sigma.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>The first strategic gate, first also of the land-wall, being
scarcely a furlong from the Propontis, offers a notable exception
to the constructive plainness of all the other entries.
Intended only as a state entry to the capital for the display
of Imperial pomp, it has been built and adorned with the
object of rendering it the most splendid object in this part
of the city. A pair of massive towers, each one hundred feet
high, advance from a façade of equal altitude, which is
traversed by three arched portals, that in the centre being
elevated to sixty feet. The whole is constructed in white
marble, and this chaste and imposing foundation is made
resplendent by the addition of gilded statues, bas-reliefs, and
mouldings. From a central pedestal above rises a figure of
Victory<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> with flowing draperies, her hand extended offering
a laurel crown. At her feet stands an equestrian statue of
Theodosius the Great,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and from the extremity of each tower
springs the two-headed Byzantine eagle.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Below, the surfaces
of the monument are ensculptured all round with mythological
designs,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> among which we may recognize Prometheus
the Fire-giver, Pegasus, Endymion, the labours of Hercules
and many others. Corinthian columns of green-veined
marble<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> bound the main portal, within which is erected a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34"> 34</span>
great cross.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> In the fore area are placed a pair of marble
elephants, recalling those used by Theodosius in his triumphal
procession after the defeat of Maximus of Gaul;
and behind these his grandson,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> the builder of the gate, has
raised a column bearing a statue of himself. Profusely
gilded, this elaborate pile is popularly and officially known
as the Golden Gate.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>To proceed with our survey we may re-embark on the
Propontis and skirt the promontory by water from end to
end of the land-wall, passing through the mouth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35"> 35</span>
Bosphorus between Europe and Asia and finishing our circuit
in the upper reaches of the Golden Horn. The single south
wall, rising from the brink of the sea, is similar to that of
Anthemius, and the towers exhibit the same diversity of
form.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Courses of rough stones immersed in the water lie
along its base and form a kind of primitive breakwater, which
saves its foundations from being sapped by the waves in
tempestuous weather. These are said to have been quarried
from the tops of the hills during the process of levelling the
ground for the extension of the city, and then, at the suggestion
of Constantine, sent rolling down the slopes until
they became lodged in their present position.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Several gates in this wall give access to the water, but
they possess no architectural distinction. Westerly is the
Porta Psamathia or Sand-gate, so called because an area of
new ground has been formed here by silting up of sand outside
the wall.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Near the opposite extremity is the Porta
Ferrea or Iron-gate, thus designated from the unstable beach
having been guarded by rails of iron to enable it to sustain
the ponderous burdens imported by Constantine.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Towards
the centre of this shore is situated the Gate of St. Aemilian,
named from its proximity to a church sacred to that martyr.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36"> 36</span>
More noticeable in this range of wall are the entrances to
two excavated harbours, each closed by a chain stretching
between a pair of containing towers. The first, at the foot
of the Xerolophos, dates from the time of Constantine, who
called it the Port of Eleutherius<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> after his master of the
works. Remade by Theodosius I, it has since been most
commonly associated with the name of that emperor.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Paved
at the bottom and surrounded by a stone quay,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> it is about
a Roman mile in circuit,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and is divided centrally by a dike
into an inner and outer basin.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> More easterly is another
similar but smaller harbour, having only one basin, designated
Port Julian<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> from its Imperial founder, but it is more often
spoken of as the New Port.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Owing, however, to the exceptional
suitability for shipping of the north side of the city,
both these harbours have gradually fallen into disuse and,
becoming choked with sand, have been looked on merely
as fit receptacles for the rubble accumulated in clearing
building sites.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> But the Port of Julian is soon to be reopened,
for, at the direction of Anastasius, rotatory pumps
have been fixed to empty it of its water and dredging operations
are in progress.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> To insure its continued patency a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37"> 37</span>
mole is even in course of construction in the Propontis over
against its mouth.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Passing the Porta Ferrea, as we begin
to round the headland, a large mansion or palace comes
into view, substituted apparently for the wall in about fifty
feet of its length. Fronted along its base with slabs of
white marble, the edifice presents a lofty stone balcony overhanging
the water,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and opening on to it, a central group of
three rectangular windows or doors with jambs and lintels
of sculptured stone. Above, a row of seven nearly semicircular
windows indicates the uppermost floor of the building,
which is known as the palace of the Boukoleon. Contiguous,
to the west, we observe a small but very ornate harbour,
formed on quite a different plan from those previously
seen. Curved piers of masonry, enriched with marbles, extending
from the land, inclose about an acre of water, which
is approached from the city by flights of white marble steps.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
On the intervening quay rests a handsome group of statuary
representing a lion and a bull in the agonies of a death
struggle.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> This is the exclusive port of the Imperial Palace,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
an important segment of which adjoins the wall at this point.
Both palace and harbour have taken the name of Boukoleon
from the piece of sculpture which so conspicuously marks the
site.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> In this vicinity, behind the wall on the city level, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38"> 38</span>
the palace of the once famous Persian refugee, Prince
Hormisdas.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Farther on is a small entry from the water leading to a
chapel sacred to the Theotokos, surnamed the Conductress,
another foundation of the devout Pulcheria.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Here are preserved
a portrait of the Virgin painted by St. Luke, the
swaddling-clothes of Jesus, and other recondite memorials of
Gospel history<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> grafted by imposture on the credulity of the
age. This Conductress,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> by virtue of a holy fount, is credited
with being able to point out the way for the blind to receive
their sight;<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and a retreat for the blind, therefore, has been
established on the spot.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>As soon as we turn the north-east point, which marks the
beginning of the Golden Horn, we exchange the inhospitable
aspect of a fortified coast for a busy scene of maritime life.
The wall recedes gradually to some distance from the waterline
and forms an inconspicuous background to the impressive
spectacle, which indicates the port of entry of a vast city. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39"> 39</span>
the course of over a mile the shore has been fashioned into
wharves from which three sets of stairs of ample width descend
to the water’s edge to facilitate the unloading of vessels.
The first stair, named from its constructor, is that of
Timasius;<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> next comes that of Chalcedon;<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and lastly the
stairs of Sycae,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> a region of the city on the opposite side of
the gulf. Alternating with the stairs are placed the entrances
of two excavated harbours: the Prosphorian Port<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> for the
landing of all kinds of imported provisions, and the Neorian
Port, used chiefly as a naval station and for ship-building.
The quays of the latter port, which are distinguished by the
brazen statue of an ox, are also habitually frequented by the
merchants of Constantinople, who make it their principal
Exchange.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Similarly the vacant spaces about the Prosphorian
Port are set apart for a cattle market.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The first issue from the city on this side is called the Gate
of Eugenius,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and is situated in the retreating portion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40"> 40</span>
wall. More remarkable is the Tower of Eugenius, called
also the Centenarian Tower,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> a massive pile closer to the
bank, which corresponds to a similar erection across the
water. These structures are the work of Constantine, who
raised them to serve as the points of attachment of a ponderous
iron chain, which should close the Golden Horn
against the attack of a hostile fleet. So far, however, no
enemy has been encountered so adventurous as to necessitate
the practical application of this means of defence.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>Beyond the stairs of Sycae the locality is called the
Zeugma.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> This tract is reserved for the storage of wood,
which, coal being unknown, is the only fuel available for
cooking, heating of baths, and all other purposes. Immense
quantities have, therefore, to be brought down by sea from
the wild countries bordering on the Euxine<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and deposited
here for the use of the Constantinopolitans. At this point
we have reached the limits of the wall of Byzantium and
henceforth to the end of the land-wall at Blachernae this side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41"> 41</span>
of the city lies open to the water. Deeming it improbable
that the town should ever be assaulted from this sequestered
inlet, Constantine and his successors have omitted to fortify
this bank. Originally this shore was indented by a number of
small creeks,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> but the teeming population, overflowing into
every available space, has now so crowded the strand with
houses that the outer rank, founded on piles, extends beyond
the water’s edge.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In the further part of this district the
stream becomes narrower, and from a projecting point a
wooden bridge has been thrown across to the opposite shore.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
In its vicinity a brazen dragon commemorates or suggests a
legend of virgins ravished and devoured until the destruction
of the monster by St. Hypatius.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> A slight expansion of the
Golden Horn at Blachernae is called the Silver Bay.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42"> 42</span></p>

<p>Having inspected the outside of Constantinople, it now
remains for us to enter the city and pass in review its principal
streets, buildings, and open spaces, whence we shall be led
to make some acquaintance with the manners and customs
of its inhabitants. From the Gate of Eugenius we can proceed
directly to the most aristocratic quarter, where a majority
of the public buildings are clustered round the Imperial
Palace. Inside we shall find that thoroughfares of three
kinds intersect the city for the purposes of general traffic:
(1) main or business streets; (2) squares or market-places;
and (3) lanes or side-streets for private residents.</p>

<p>(1) A main street consists of an open paved road, not
more than fifteen feet wide, bounded on each side by a
colonnade or portico. More than fifty of such porticoes are
in existence at this date, so that a pedestrian can traverse
almost the whole city under shelter from sun or rain.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Many
of them have an upper floor, approached by wooden or stone
steps, which is used as an <i>ambulacrum</i> or promenade. They
are plentifully adorned with statuary of all kinds, especially
above,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> and amongst these presentments of the reigning
emperor are not infrequent. The latter may be seen in busts
of brass and marble, in brazen masks, and even in painted
tablets.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Such images are consecrated and are sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43"> 43</span>
surreptitiously adored by the populace with religious rites.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
They are also endowed with the legal attribute of sanctuary,
and slaves not uncommonly fly to them for refuge as a protest
against ill-treatment by their masters.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Portraits of popular
actors, actresses, and charioteers may also be observed,
but they are liable to be torn down if posted close to the
Imperial images or in any position too reputable for their
pretensions.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> On the inside the porticoes are lined for the
most part by shops and workshops.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Opening on to them in
certain positions are public halls or auditoriums, architecturally
decorative and furnished with seats, where meetings can
be held and professors can lecture to classes on various topics.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
Between the pillars of the colonnades next the thoroughfare
we find stalls and tables for the sale of all kinds of wares. In
the finer parts of the city such stalls or booths must by law
be ornamentally constructed and encrusted outside with
marbles so as not to mar the beauty of the piazza.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> At the
tables especially are seated the money-changers or bankers,
who lend money at usury, receive it at interest, and act
generally as the pawnbrokers of the capital.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Such pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44"> 44</span>
arcades have naturally become the habitual resort of
courtezans,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and they are recognized as the legitimate place
of shelter for the houseless poor.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>(2) The open spaces, to which the Latin name of <i>forum</i>
is applied more often than the Greek word <i>agora</i>, are expansions
of the main streets, and, like them, are surrounded on
all sides by porticoes. They are not, however, very numerous
and about a dozen will comprise all that have been constructed
within the capital. They originate in the necessity
of preserving portions of the ground unoccupied for use as
market-places, but the vacant area is always more or less
decorative and contains one or more monuments of ornament
or utility. Each one is named distinctively either from
the nature of the traffic carried on therein or in honour of
its founder, and most of them will deserve special attention
during our itinerary of the city.</p>

<p>(3) The greater part of the ground area of Constantinople
is, of course, occupied by residential streets, and these are
usually, according to modern ideas, of quite preposterous
narrowness.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Few of them are more than ten feet wide, and
this scanty space is still more contracted above by projecting
floors and balconies. In many places also the public way is
encroached upon by <i>solaria</i> or sun-stages, that is to say by
balconies supported on pillars of wood or marble, and often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45"> 45</span>
furnished with a flight of stairs leading to the pavement
below. In such alleys low windows, affording a view of the
street, or facile to lean out of,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> are considered unseemly by
the inmates of opposite houses. Hence mere light-giving
apertures, placed six feet above the flooring, are the regular
means of illumination. Transparent glass is sometimes used
for the closure of windows, but more often we find thin plates
of marble or alabaster with ornamental designs figured on
the translucent substance.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Simple wooden shutters, however,
are seen commonly enough in houses of the poorer class.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Impatient to see the immense vacant area which he added
to Byzantium covered with houses Constantine exercised
little or no supervision over private builders; necessary
thoroughfares became more or less blocked, walls of public
edifices were appropriated as buttresses for hastily erected
tenements, and the task of evolving order out of the resulting
chaos was imposed on succeeding rulers.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> On Constantinople
becoming the seat of empire, as a resident of the period
remarks, “such a multitude of people flocked hither from all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46"> 46</span>
parts, allured by military or mercantile pursuits, that the
citizens out of doors and even at home are endangered by
the unprecedented crush of men and animals.”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> In 447
Zeno, taking advantage of an extensive fire, promulgated a
very stringent building act, contravention of which renders
the offending structure liable to demolition, and inflicts a fine
of ten pounds of gold on the owner. The architect also becomes
liable in a similar amount, and is even subjected to
banishment if unable to pay.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> By this act, which remains
permanently in force throughout the Empire, the not very
ample width of twelve feet is fixed for private streets, <i>solaria</i>
and balconies must be at least ten feet distant from similar
projections on the opposite side, and not less than fifteen feet
above the pavement; whilst stairs connecting them directly
with the thoroughfare are entirely abolished. Prospective
windows also are forbidden in streets narrower than the
statutory allowance of twelve feet. These enactments, however,
too restricted in their practical application, have done
but little to relieve the congested thoroughfares. Thus, long
afterwards, another resident complains that every spot of
ground is occupied by contiguous dwellings to such an extent
that “scarcely can an open space be discovered, which
affords a clear view of the sky without raising the eyes
aloft.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>These by-streets, of which there are more than four hundred<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
in the capital, consist chiefly of houses suitable for
single families of the middle or lower classes. There are also,
however, a large number of dwellings for collective habitation,
which cover a greater area and rise by successive stories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47"> 47</span>
to an unusual height; but by law they are not allowed to
exceed an altitude of one hundred feet.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> When one side of
such buildings is situated next a portico the adjacent part of
the ground floor is usually fitted up as a range of shops.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Besides the ordinary domiciles, which constitute the bulk
of the city, there are the mansions or palaces of the wealthy,
situated in various choice and open positions throughout the
town. Such residences are generally two-storied, and have
ornamental façades on which sculptured pillars both above
and below are conspicuous. The windows, arched or rectangular,
are divided by a central pilaster, and the roof, usually
slanting, is covered with wood or thin slabs of stone. Within,
a lofty hall is supported on tall columns surmounted by
gilded capitals, and the walls are inlaid with polished marbles
of various colours and textures. Throughout the house the
principal apartments are similarly decorated, and even bedrooms
are not destitute of the columnar adornments so dear
to luxurious Byzantines. Ceilings are almost invariably
fretted and liberally gilt. In houses of this class a central
court, contained by a colonnade, giving air and light to the
whole building, is considered a necessity. Much wealth is
often expended in order to give this space the appearance of
a landscape in miniature. Trees wave, fountains play, and
artificial streams roll over counterfeited cliffs into pools
stocked with tame fish.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Within the gate of Eugenius we are on the northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48"> 48</span>
slopes of the first hill, whereon was placed the citadel of
Byzantium. Rounding it to the east we soon approach a
tall Corinthian column of white marble, bearing on its summit
a statue of Byzas,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> a memorial of the victories by land
and sea of Venerianus or other Byzantine generals over the
marauding Goths about 266.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> “Fortune has returned to the
city,” so runs the inscription on the base, “since the Goths
have been overcome.”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> But these events have now passed
into oblivion, and the vicinity is given up to low taverns,
whilst in the popular mind the monument is associated with
the more signal exploits of Pompey the Great in his Mithridatic
wars.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> To the south of this pillar, and close to the
eastern wall, is situated the Imperial arsenal or Manganon,
founded by Constantine, a repertory of weapons of all
descriptions, and of machines used in the attack and defence
of fortifications.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> It contains, besides, a military library.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Passing the Cynegium, a deserted amphitheatre of pre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49"> 49</span>-Constantinian
date,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and a small theatre, we may make the
circuit of the first hill on the south side and enter the chief
square of the city. This area, the ancient market-place of
Byzantium,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> is called the Augusteum,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> that is the Imperial
Forum; and it forms a court to those edifices which are
particularly frequented by the Emperor. Around it are
situated his Palace, his church, his Senate-House, and a
vast Circus or Hippodrome, where the populace and their
ruler are accustomed to meet face to face. Almost all the
public buildings at this date, which aspire to architectural
beauty, are constructed more or less exactly after the model
of the classical Greek temple; that is, they are oblong, and
have at each end a pediment corresponding to the extremities
of a slanting roof. The eaves, projecting widely and
supported on pillars, form a portico round the body of the
building, which, in the most decorative examples, is excavated
externally by a series of niches for the reception of
statues.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The vestibule of the Palace, which opens on the
southern portico of the Augusteum, is a handsome pillared
hall named Chalke, or the Brazen House, from being roofed
with tiles of gilded brass.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> An image of Christ, devoutly
placed over the brazen gates which close the entrance, dates
back to Constantine,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> but the remainder of the building has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50"> 50</span>
lately been restored by Anastasius.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> This vestibule leads to
several spacious chambers or courts which are rather of an
official than of a residential character. Amongst these most
room is given to the quarters of the Imperial guards, which
are divided into four companies called Scholars, Excubitors,
Protectors, and Candidates respectively.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The latter are
distinguished by wearing white robes when in personal
attendance on the Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Here also we find a state
prison, the Noumera, a great banqueting hall, the Triclinium
of Nineteen Couches, and a Consistorium or Throne-room.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Three porphyry steps at one end of this apartment lead to
the throne itself, which consists of an elaborately carved
chair adorned with ivory, jewels, and precious metals. It is
placed beneath a silver <i>ciborium</i>, that is, a small dome raised
on four pillars just sufficiently elevated to permit of the
occupant standing upright. The whole is ornamentally
moulded, a pair of silver eagles spread their wings on the
top of the dome, and the interior can be shut in by drawing
rich curtains hung between the columns.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51"> 51</span></p>

<p>Beyond Chalke, the term includes its dependencies, we
enter a court, colonnaded as usual, which leads on the
right to a small church dedicated to St. Stephen,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> the upper
galleries of which overlook the Hippodrome. On the left,
that is on the east of this court, is an octagonal hall, the first
chamber in a more secluded section of the palace called
Daphne.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> It derives its name from a notable statue of
Daphne, so well known in Greek fable as the maiden who
withstood Apollo.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> On the domed roof of this second
vestibule stands a figure, representing the Fortune of the
City, erected by Constantine.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The palace of Daphne
contains the private reception rooms of the Emperor and
Empress, whose chief personal attendants are a band of
nobles entitled Silentiaries. The duty of these officers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52"> 52</span>
amongst whom Anastasius was included before his elevation
to the purple,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> is to keep order in the Imperial chambers.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
The terraces and balconies of Daphne, which face the west,
overlook the Hippodrome. Adjoining the Palace on the
south is an area fitted up as a private circus, which is used
by members of the Court for equestrian exercises.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>Passing through Daphne to the east we enter a further
court, and find ourselves opposite a third vestibule which,
being of a semi-elliptical form, is called the Sigma of the
Palace.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> The division of the Imperial residence to which
this hall introduces us is specially the Sacred or “God-guarded”
Palace, because it contains the “sacred cubicle”
or sleeping apartment of the Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> In this quarter a
numerous band of cubicularies or eunuchs of the bed-chamber
have their principal station, controlled by the
Praepositus of the sacred cubicle.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Here also are a crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53"> 53</span>
of vestiaries or dressers who are occupied with the royal
apparel, including females of various grades with similar
titles for the service of the Empress. At the eastern limit of
the Palace stands the Pharos, a beacon tower afterwards, if
not now, the first of a series throughout Asia Minor by
which signals were flashed to and from the capital.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The
Tzykanisterion,<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Imperial Gardens, large enough to be called
a park, occupies a great part of the south-eastern corner of
the peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> It is surrounded, or rather fortified, by substantial
walls which join the sea walls of the city on the east
and south.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The western section, which terminates on the
south near the palace of Hormisdas and Port Julian, is
surmounted by a covered terrace named the Gallery of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54"> 54</span>
Marcian,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> the emperor who caused it to be constructed. A
detached edifice within this inclosure, close to the Bucoleon
Port, possesses considerable historical interest. It is called
the Porphyry Palace, and Constantine is said to have enjoined
on his successors that each empress at her lying-in
should occupy a chamber in this building.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Hence the
royal children are distinguished by the epithet of Porphyrogeniti
or “born in the purple.” The edifice is square, and
the roof rises to a point like a pyramid. The walls and
floors are covered with a rare species of speckled purple
marble imported from Rome.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Hence its name. All parts
of the Imperial palace are profusely adorned with statues,
some mythological, others historical, representing rulers of
the Empire, their families, or prominent statesmen and
generals. Chapels or oratories dedicated to various saints
are attached to every important section of the building.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The north side of the Augusteum, opposite the vestibule<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55"> 55</span>
of Chalke, is occupied by an oblong edifice with an arched
wooden roof,<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> the basilica of St. Sophia,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> commonly
called the Great Church. The entrance faces the east,<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and
leads from a cloistered forecourt to a narrow hall, named
the <i>narthex</i>, which extends across the whole width of the
church. The interior consists of a wide nave separated from
lateral aisles by rows of Corinthian columns, which support
a gallery on each side. At the end of the nave stands the
pulpit or <i>ambo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> approached by a double flight of steps, one
on each side. Behind the <i>ambo</i> the body of the church is
divided from the <i>Bema</i> or chancel by a lofty carved screen,
decorated with figures of sacred personages, called later the
<i>Iconostasis</i> or image-stand. Three doors in the <i>Iconostasis</i>
lead to the <i>Bema</i>, which contains the altar,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> a table of costly
construction enriched with gold and gems, and covered by
a large and handsome <i>ciborium</i>. The edifice is terminated
by an apse furnished with an elevated seat, which forms the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56"> 56</span>
throne of the Patriarch or Archbishop of Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
Light enters through mullioned windows glazed with plates
of translucent marble. Every available space in the church
is adorned with statues to the number of several hundreds,
the majority of them representing pagan divinities and personifications
of the celestial signs. Among them is a nearly
complete series of the Roman emperors, whilst Helena, the
mother of Constantine, appears thrice over in different
materials, porphyry, silver, and ivory.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Close to St. Sophia
on the north is the church of St. Irene, one of the earliest
buildings erected for Christian worship by Constantine. It
is usually called the Old Church.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Between these two sacred
piles stands a charitable foundation, Sampson’s Hospital,
practically a refuge for incurables reduced by disease to a
state of destitution.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Yet a third place of worship in this
locality to the north-west of the Great Church may be mentioned,
Our Lady (Theotokos) of the Brassworkers, built in
a tract previously devoted to Jewish artisans of that class.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>On the east side of the Augusteum are situated two
important public buildings, viz., the Senate-house, and, to
the south of it, a palatial hall, the grand triclinium of
Magnaura.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The latter stands back some distance from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57"> 57</span>
square in an open space planted with trees,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and consists of
a pillared façade, from whence we pass into a vast chamber
supported on marble columns. It is the largest of the State
reception rooms, and is the established rendezvous of
Imperial pageantry whenever it is desirable to overawe the
mind of foreign ambassadors.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Next to Chalke on the west is placed the handsomest public
bath in the city, that of Zeuxippus, the most ambitious work
of Severus during his efforts at restoration.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> It is compassed
by ample colonnades which are conjoined with those of the
Palace,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and are especially notable for their wealth of
statuary in bronze and marble, dating from the best period
of Grecian art. Within and without, in the palatial halls and
chambers encrusted with marble and mosaic work, and in the
niches of the porticoes, are to be found almost all the gods
and goddesses, the poets, politicians, and philosophers of
Greece and Rome, as celebrated by the Coptic poet Christodorus
in a century of epigrams.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Amongst these a draped
full-length figure of Homer is particularly admired: with his
arms crossed upon his breast, his hair and beard unkempt,
his brows bent in deep thought, his eyes fixed and expressionless
in token of blindness, the bard is represented as he
lived, absorbed in the creation of some sublime epic.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58"> 58</span>
bath, or institution,<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> as it may properly be called, is brilliantly
illuminated during the dark hours of night and morning on
an improved system devised by the Praefect Cyrus Constantine.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>On the west side of the Augusteum the ground is chiefly
taken up by a large covered bazaar, in which dress fabrics of
the most expensive kind, silks, and cloth of gold, are warehoused
for sale to the Byzantine aristocracy. It is known as
the House of Lamps, on account of the multitude of lights
which are here ignited for the display of the goods after
nightfall.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Close by is the Octagon, an edifice bordered by
eight porticoes. It contains a library and a lecture theatre,
and is the meeting-place of a faculty of erudite monks, who
constitute a species of privy council frequently consulted by
the Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Preferment to the highest ecclesiastical
dignities is the recognized destiny of its members. In the
same vicinity is a basilica named the Royal Porch, wherein
is preserved a library founded by the Emperor Julian.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Here
principally judicial causes are heard, and its colonnades have
become the habitual resort of advocates, who for the
greater part of each day frequent the place in expectation of,
or consulting with, clients.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59"> 59</span></p>

<p>In the open area of the Augusteum we may notice several
important monuments. South of St. Sophia are two silver
statues raised on pedestals, one on the west representing the
great Theodosius,<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and another on the east opposite the
Senate-house, a female figure in a trailing robe, the Empress
Eudoxia, wife of Arcadius. This is the famous statue round
which the populace used to dance and sing so as to disturb
the church service in the time of Chrysostom, whose invectives
against the custom were deemed an insult by the
Court, and made the occasion of his deposition and banishment.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
Adjoining is a third statue, that of Leo Macella,
elevated by means of a succession of steps, whereon popular
suitors for Imperial justice are wont to deposit their petitions.
These are regularly collected and submitted to the Emperor
for his decision, whence the monument is called the Pittakia
or petition-stone.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Near the same spot is a fountain known
as the Geranium.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> The most important structure, however,
is the Golden Milestone or Milion,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> situated in the south-west
corner of the square. This is merely a gilded column
to mark the starting-point of the official measurement of
distances, which are registered systematically on mile-stones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60"> 60</span>
fixed along all the main roads of the Empire. But, in order
to signalize its position, a grand triumphal arch, quadrilateral,
with equal sides, and four entries, has been erected above it.
The arch is surmounted by figures of Constantine and his
mother holding a great cross between them. This group is
of such magnitude that it is not dwarfed by equestrian statues
of Trajan and Hadrian, which are placed behind it.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Beneath
the arch a flying group, representing the chariot of the Sun,
drawn by four flame-coloured horses, is elevated upon two
lofty pillars.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>The Hippodrome or Circus commences near the Milion,
whence it stretches southwards towards the sea and terminates
in the vicinity of the Sigma of Julian,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> a crescentic portico
verging on the harbour of that name. It is an artificially
constructed racecourse having an external length of about a
quarter of a mile, and a breadth of nearly half that distance.
This elongated space, straight on the north and round at the
opposite end, is contained within a corniced wall decorated
outside with engaged Corinthian columns, thirty feet in
height.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Owing to the declivity of the ground as it sinks
towards the shore, the circular portion of the architectural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61"> 61</span>
boundary is supported on arcades which gradually diminish
in altitude on each side as they approach the centre of the
inclosure.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Interiorly, except at the straight end, a sloping
series of marble benches<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> runs continuously round the arena,
the level of which is maintained in the <i>sphendone</i> or rounded
part by the vaulted substructions based on the incline of the
hill.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The northern extremity is flanked by a pair of towers,
between which, on the ground level, lies the Manganon,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
offices for the accommodation of horses, chariots, and charioteers.
Above the Manganon is placed the Kathisma,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> the
name given to the seat occupied in state by the Emperor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62"> 62</span>
when viewing the races. It is situated in a covered balcony
or lodge fronted by a low balustrade, and is surrounded by
an ample space for the reception of guards and attendant
courtiers. In advance of the Kathisma, but on a lower level,
is a square platform sustained by marble columns called the
Stama, which is the station of a company of Imperial guards
with standard-bearers.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Behind the Kathisma is a suite of
retiring rooms, from whence a winding staircase<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> leads, by
the gallery of St. Stephen’s chapel, to the colonnades of
Daphne. This is the royal route to the Circus.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The whole
of the edifice superimposed on the Manganon is named the
Palace of the Kathisma or of the Hippodrome.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> A narrow
terrace constructed in masonry, about three feet high, extends
along the centre of the arena equidistant from all parts of the
peripheral boundary. This Spine, as it was called in the old
Roman nomenclature, but now renamed the Euripus,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> serves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63"> 63</span>
to divide the track of departure from that of return. It is
adorned from end to end with a range of monuments of great
diversity. In the middle stands an Egyptian obelisk, inscribed
with the usual hieroglyphs, resting on four balls sustained in
turn by a square pedestal. An inscription at the bottom of
the pedestal, illustrated by diagrams, exhibits the engineering
methods adopted under the great Theodosius for the erection
of the monolith on its present site; higher up elaborate
sculptures show the Emperor in his seat presiding at the
games.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Farther to the south is a still loftier column of the
same shape, covered with brass plates, called the Colossus.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
Intermediately is the brazen pillar, ravished from the temple
of Delphi, composed of the twisted bodies of three serpents,
whose heads formerly supported the golden tripod dedicated
to Apollo by the Grecian states in memory of the defeat of
the Persians at Plateia.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> The names of the subscribing communities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64"> 64</span>
can still be read engraved on the folds of the snakes.
Adjacent is a lofty pillar bearing the figure of a nymph with
flowing robes, who holds forth a mail-clad knight mounted on
horseback with one hand.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Near the south end is a fountain
or bath with a central statue, known as the Phial of the
Hippodrome.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Contiguous is an aedicule raised on four
pillars, in which is displayed the laurelled bust of the reigning
Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Above the obelisk, on a column, is a celebrated
statue of Hercules Trihesperus by Lysippus; the hero of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65"> 65</span>
colossal size, in a downcast mood seated on his lion’s hide.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
There are also several pyramids in various positions along
the Spine as well as numerous figures of famous charioteers
interspersed among the other ornaments.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> To these are to be
added the necessary furniture of the Spine of a Roman Circus,
viz., the narrow stages raised on a pair of pillars at each end,
the one supporting seven ovoid bodies, by the removal or replacing
of which the spectators at both extremities are enabled
to see how many laps of the course have been travelled
over by the chariots; the other, seven dolphins,<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> ornamental
waterspouts through which water is pumped into the Phial
beneath.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> At each end of the Euripus are the usual triple
cones,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> figured with various devices, the “goals” designed to
make the turning-points of the arena conspicuous. Over the
Manganon, on each side external to the Kathisma, are a pair
of gilded horses removed by Theodosius II from the Isle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66"> 66</span>
Chios.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The Podium, or lower boundary of the marble benches,
is elevated about twelve feet above the floor of the arena by
a columnar wall;<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> at the upper limit of these seats a level
terrace or promenade is carried completely round the Circus.
This walk is crowded with statues in brass and stone, many
of them inscribed with their place of origin, from whence
they have been carried off.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> A number of them are deserving
of special mention: a bronze eagle with expanded pinions
rending a viper with its talons, and engraved with mystic
symbols beneath the wings, said to have been erected by the
arch-charlatan or illusionist, Apollonius Tyaneus, as a charm
against the serpents which infested Byzantium;<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> a group representing
the semi-piscine Scylla devouring the companions
of Ulysses, who had been engulfed by Charybdis;<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> the figure
of a eunuch named Plato, formerly a Grand Chamberlain,
removed from a church notwithstanding a prohibition cut on
the breast: “May he who moves me be strangled”;<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> a man
driving an ass, set up by Augustus at Actium in memory of
his having met, the night before that battle, a wayfarer thus
engaged, who, on being questioned, replied, “I am named
Victor, my ass is Victoria, and I am going to Caesar’s camp;”<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
the infants Romulus and Remus with their foster-mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67"> 67</span>
the wolf;<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> a Helen of the rarest beauty, her charms enhanced
by the most captivating dress and ornaments; a factitious
basilisk crushing an asp between its teeth; a hippopotamus,
a man grappling with a lion, several sphinxes,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> a well-known
hunchback in a comic attitude,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> statues of emperors on foot
and on horseback, and various subjects from pagan mythology,
the whole representing the spoliation of more than a score of
cities looted in time of peace at the caprice of a despot.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
Four handsome arched gateways, two on each side, with containing
towers,<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> give the public access to the interior of the
Hippodrome.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> That on the south-east is named the Gate of
the Dead,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> a term which originated at the time when a special
entry was reserved for removing the bodies of those slain in
the fatal, but now obsolete, combats of gladiators. The
Sphendone, however, is now frequently used for the execution
of offenders of rank, not always criminal, and this portal has
still, therefore, some practical right to its name.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> When necessary,
the Circus can be covered with an awning as a protection
against the sun or bad weather.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68"> 68</span></p>

<p>From the western arch of the Milion we enter the Mese,
that is, the Middle, Main, or High Street of the city, which
traverses the whole town from east to west with a southerly
inclination between the Augusteum and the Golden Gate.
It is bounded in almost all of its course by porticoes said to
have been constructed by Eubulus, one of the wealthy Romans
who were induced to migrate by Constantine. The
same patrician gifted the city with two other colonnades
which extend for a considerable distance along the eastern
portion of the north and south shores.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> The Mese proceeds
at first between the north of the Hippodrome and the Judicial
or Royal Basilica with the adjacent buildings already mentioned.
Contiguous to the Royal Porch is a life-size statue
of an elephant with his keeper, erected by Severus to commemorate
the fact that the animal had killed a money-changer,
who was afterwards proved dishonest, to avenge the death
of his master.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Near the western flank of the Circus is the
Palace of Lausus, said to be one of those reared by Constantine
to allure some of the Roman magnates to reside
permanently in his new capital.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Subsequently, however, it
was transformed into an inn for the public entertainment of
strangers.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> In its vestibule and galleries were collected many
gems of Grecian statuary, but most of these have been destroyed
by the great fire which raged in this quarter under
Zeno.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Amongst them were the celebrated Venus of Cnidos
in white marble, a nude work of Praxiteles;<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> the Lindian
Athene in smaragdite; the Samian Hera of Lysippus; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69"> 69</span>
chryselephantine, or ivory and gold statue of Zeus by Phidias,
which Pericles placed in the temple at Olympia;<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> an allegorical
figure of Time by Lysippus, having hair on the frontal
part of the head, but with the back bald; and also many figures
of animals, including a cameleopard.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>Proceeding onwards for about a quarter of a mile we pass
on our right the Argyropratia, that is, the abode of the silversmiths,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
and arrive at the Forum of Constantine, which
presents itself as an expansion of the Mese. This open space,
the most signal ornament of Constantinople, is called prescriptively
the Forum; and sometimes, from its finished
marble floor, “The Pavement.” Two lofty arches of white
Proconnesian marble, opposed to each other from east to
west, are connected by curvilinear porticoes so as to inclose
a circular area.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> From its centre rises a tall porphyry column
bound at intervals with brazen laurel wreaths. This pillar is
surmounted by a figure of Constantine with the attributes
of the Sun-god, his head resplendent with a halo of gilded
rays.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The mystic Trojan Palladium, furtively abstracted
from Rome, is buried beneath the monument, on the base
of which an inscription piously invokes Christ to become the
guardian of the city.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The sculptural decorations of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70"> 70</span>
Forum are very numerous: the Fortune of the City, called
Anthusa, was originally set up here, and adored with bloodless
sacrifices;<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> a pair of great crosses inscribed with words
of the Creed and Doxology are erected on opposite sides;
Constantine with his mother Helena, and a pair of winged
angels form a group about the one, whilst the sons of the
same emperor surround the other.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Here also may be seen
Athene, her neck encircled by snakes emanating from the
Gorgon’s head fixed in her aegis; Amphitrite distinguished
by a crown of crab’s claws; a dozen statues of porphyry ranged
in one portico, and an equal number of gilded sirens or sea-horses
in the other; and lastly the bronze gates bestowed by
Trajan on the temple of Diana at Ephesus, embossed with a
series of subjects illustrating the theogonies of Greece and
Rome. These latter adorn the entrance to the original
Senate-house which is situated on the south side of the Forum.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>If we diverge from the Mese slightly to the north-east
of the Pavement, we shall enter a large square named the
Strategium, from its forming a parade-ground to the barracks
of the Palatine troops.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Amongst several monuments a
Theban obelisk conspicuously occupies the middle place,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
but the most striking object is an equestrian figure of Constantine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71"> 71</span>
with the pillar alongside it by which Constantinople
is officially declared to be a second Rome.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> This locality
is associated in historic tradition with Alexander the
Great, of whom it contains a commemorative statue.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> From
hence he is said to have started on his expedition against
Darius after holding a final review of his forces. On this
account it was chosen by Severus as a permanent site for
military quarters.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> The public prison is also located in this
square.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>Continuing our way beneath the piazzas of the Mese beyond
the Forum of Constantine we reach the district known
as the Artopolia or public bakeries which lie to the north of
the main street. A strange group of statuary, allegorizing
the fecundity of nature, is collocated in this region, viz., a
many-headed figure in which the faces of a dozen animals
are seen in conjunction; amongst them are those of a lion,
an eagle, a peacock, a ram, a bull, a crow, a mouse, a hare,
a cat, and a weasel. This eccentric presentment is flanked
by a pair of marble Gorgons.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Adjacent we may also observe
a paved area in which a cross stands conspicuously on a
pillar, another record of the hybrid piety of Constantine.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Farther on by a couple of furlongs is the great square of
Taurus, also called the Forum of Theodosius, through its
being specially devoted to memorials of that prince. It covers
an oblong space, extending from level ground on the south
up the slope of the third hill, the summit of which it includes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72"> 72</span>
in its northern limit.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> This eminence, in accordance with the
conception of making Constantinople a counterpart of Rome,
is called the Capitol, and is occupied by an equivalent of the
Tabularium, that is, by a building which contains the
Imperial archives.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Similarly, this site has been chosen for
an edifice composed of halls and a lecture-theatre assigned
to a faculty of thirty professors appointed by government to
direct the liberal studies of the youth of the capital—in short,
for the University, as we may call it, of Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> The
principal monument in Taurus is the column of Theodosius
I, the sculptural shaft of which illustrates in an ascending
spiral the Gothic victories of that Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> But the equestrian
statue which originally crowned this pictured record of
his achievements, having been overthrown by an earthquake,
has lately been replaced by a figure of the unwarlike
Anastasius.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> To the north of this column, on a tetrapyle or
duplex arch, Theodosius the Less presides over the titular
Forum of his grandfather.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> But in the fading memory of the
populace the figure of this Emperor is already confounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73"> 73</span>
with a horseman said to have been abstracted from Antioch,
whom some imagine to be Jesus Nava,<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and others Bellerophon.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
Facing each other from east to west on opposite
sides of the square are arches supporting figures of those
degenerate representatives of the Theodosian dynasty, Arcadius
and Honorius.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> To the western of these arches we
may observe that an assortment of troublesome insects,
counterfeited in brass, have been carefully affixed—another
charm of Apollonius Tyaneus intended to protect the
inhabitants against such diminutive pests.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> In this vicinity
is also a palace, built by Constantine, in which strangers from
all parts are hospitably entertained without expense or
question.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>From the west side of Taurus we may perceive the great
aqueduct of Valens, which crosses the third valley, and is here
conjoined with the chief <i>Nymphaeum</i>, a decorative public hall
built around a fountain.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Several of these <i>Nymphaea</i> exist in
the city, and they are often made use of for private entertainments,
especially nuptial festivals, by citizens who have
not sufficient space for such purposes in their own homes.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
The water supply of the town is under the care of a special
Consul, and very stringent laws are in force to prevent waste
or injury to the structures necessary for its storage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74"> 74</span>
distribution.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> With the exception, however, of that of Valens,
aerial aqueducts (so conspicuous at Rome) have not been
carried near to, or within, the walls of Constantinople; and
subterranean pipes of lead or earthenware are the usual means
of conveying the precious liquid from place to place.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> The
public cisterns are in themselves a striking architectural
feature of the city. Some of these are open basins, but many
of them possess vaulted roofs, upborne by hundreds of
columns whose capitals are sculptured in the varied styles of
Byzantine art.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Most of these receptacles for water are
distinguished by special names; thus, beneath the Sphendone
of the Hippodrome, we have the Cold cistern,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and near to
the palace or <i>hospice</i> of Lausus the Philoxenus, or Travellers’
Friend.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> By a law of Theodosius II, the wharf dues, paid for
the use of the various stairs on the Golden Horn, are applied
to the repair of the aqueducts, the supply of water from which
is free to the public.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> In connection with the cisterns a group
of three storks in white marble is pointed out as a further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75"> 75</span>
result of the fruitful visit of Apollonius Tyaneus to Byzantium;
owing to the district becoming infested by serpents, flocks
of these birds were attracted hither, and caused a terrible
nuisance through having contracted a habit of casting the
dead bodies of the reptiles into the water reservoirs; but the
erection of this monument speedily achieved their perpetual
banishment from the city.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>If we step aside a short distance from Taurus, both on the
north and south sides, we shall in each case come upon an
interesting monument. 1. On the far side of the Capitol,
overlooking the Zeugma, on a marble pillar, is a noted statue
of Venus, which marks the site of the only <i>lupanar</i> permitted
by Constantine to exist in his new capital.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Around, each
secluded within its curtained lattice, are a series of bowers
consecrated to the illicit, or rather mercenary, amours of the
town. The goddess, however, who presides here is credited
with a remarkable leaning towards chastity; for, it is believed,
that if a wife or maid suspected of incontinence be brought
to this statue, instead of denying her guilt, she will by an
irresistible impulse cast off her garments so as to give an
ocular proof of her shamelessness.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> 2. To the south, elevated
on four pillars, is a lofty pyramid of bronze, the apex of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76"> 76</span>
which sustains a female figure pivoted so as to turn with every
breath of wind. The surfaces of the pyramid are decorated
with a set of much admired bas-reliefs; on one side a sylvan
scene peopled with birds depicted in flight or song; on
another a pastoral idyl representing shepherds piping to their
flocks, whilst the lambs are seen gambolling over the green;
again, a marine view with fishers casting their nets amid
shoals of fish startled and darting in all directions; lastly, a
mimic battle in which mirthful bands of Cupids assault each
other with apples and pomegranates. This elaborate vane,
which is visible over a wide area, is known as the <i>Anemodulion</i>,
or Slave of the Winds.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>Beyond Taurus the Mese leads us to the <i>Philadelphium</i>,
a spot dedicated to brotherly love and embellished by a group
representing the three sons of Constantine in an affectionate
attitude. The monument commemorates the last meeting of
these noble youths, who, on hearing of the death of their
father, encountered each other here prior to assuming the
government of their respective divisions of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
Opposite is another group of the same princes, who ultimately
destroyed each other, erected by Constantine himself with
the usual accompaniment of a large gilt cross.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> A few paces
farther on, our route is again interrupted by a square, the
entrance to which is marked by a Tetrapyle, or arch of four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77"> 77</span>
portals, executed in brass. Above the first gateway is affixed
a significant symbol, namely, a modius or measure for wheat
standing between a pair of severed hands. It records the
punishment by Valentinian I of an unjust dealer who ignored
his law that corn should be sold to the people with the measure
heaped up to overflowing.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The Forum on which the
Tetrapyle opens is called the <i>Amastrianum</i>, perhaps from a
wanderer belonging to Amastris in Paphlagonia, who was
found dead on this spot.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> It is the usual place of public
execution for the lower classes, whether capital or by mutilation.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
This square, which is close to the streamlet Lycus,<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> is
no exception to the rule that such open spaces should be
crowded with statues. Among them we may notice the Sun-god
in a marble chariot, a reclining Hercules, shells with
birds resting on the rim, and nearly a score of dragons.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Yet two more open spaces on the Mese arrest our progress
as we proceed to the Golden Gate. The first is the Forum
of the Ox, which contains a colossal quadruped of that species
brought hither from Pergamus.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> This is in reality a brazen
furnace for the combustion of malefactors condemned to
perish by fire, and has the credit of having given some martyrs
to the Church, especially under the Emperor Julian.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
Farther on is the last square we shall find it necessary to view,
the Forum of Arcadius, founded by that prince.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Its distinguishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78"> 78</span>
monument is a column similar in every way to
that in Taurus,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> but the silver statue which surmounts it is
the figure of Arcadius himself.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> We are now on the top of
the Xerolophos, and the colonnades which lead hence to the
walls of Theodosius are named the <i>Porticus Troadenses</i>.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
But about halfway to the present Imperial portal we pass
through the original Golden Gate,<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> a landmark which has
been spared in the course of the old walls of Constantine.
The extensive tract added by Theodosius II to the interior
of the city was formerly the camping ground of the seven
bodies of Gothic auxiliaries, and for that reason was divided
into seven districts, denoted numerically from south to north.
The whole of this quarter is now spoken of as the <i>Exokionion</i>,
that is, the region outside the Pillar, in allusion to a
well-known statue of Constantine which marks the border.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
But, in order to particularize the smaller areas of this quarter,
some of the numbers are still found indispensable, and we
often hear of the Deuteron, Triton, Pempton, and Hebdomon.
Adjacent to the Golden Gate is situated the great
monastery of St. John Studii, which maintains a thousand
monks.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79"> 79</span></p>

<p>On entering the <i>Exokionion</i> the Mese gives off a branch
thoroughfare which leads to the Gate of the Fountain, skirting
on its way the church of St. Mocius, a place of worship
granted to the Arians by Theodosius I when he established
the Nicene faith at Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> By this route also we
arrive at a portico which adorns the interior of the mural
Sigma,<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and contains a monument to Theodosius II erected
by his Grand Chamberlain, the infamous eunuch Chrysaphius.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>If we now retrace our steps to the Philadelphium and diverge
thence from the Mese in a north-westerly direction,
we shall soon reach the church of the Holy Apostles, the
most imposing of the Christian edifices founded by Constantine.
It is contained within an open court surrounded
by cloisters, on which give the numerous offices required for
the guardians of the sacred precincts. This church is one of
the first of those constructed in the form of a cross.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Outside
it is covered with variegated marbles, and the roof is composed
of tiles of gilded brass. The interior is elaborately
decorated with a panelled ceiling and walls invested with
trellis-work of an intricate pattern, the whole being profusely
gilded. Cenotaphs ranged in order are consecrated to the
honour and glory of the Twelve Apostles, and in the midst
of these is a porphyry sarcophagus wherein repose the remains
of Constantine himself and his mother. The building
is in fact a <i>heroon</i> or mausoleum designed to perpetuate the
fulminating flattery of the period by which Constantine was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80"> 80</span>
declared to be the “equal of the Apostles.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Subsequently,
however, this religious pile was adopted as the customary
place of interment of the Imperial families, and many tombs
of royal personages are now to be seen scattered around.
Amongst them lie the sons of Constantine, Theodosius I and
II, Arcadius, Marcian, Pulcheria, Leo I, and Zeno.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> On
leaving this spot, if we turn to the south for a short distance,
we shall be enabled to examine a tall column with a heavy
capital elaborately sculptured in a Byzantino-Corinthian
style. An inscription on the pedestal testifies to its having
been erected by the Praefect Tatian to the memory of the
Emperor Marcian.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>The region of Sycae, built on the steep slope of the hill
which rises almost from the water’s edge to the north of the
Golden Horn, is considered to be an integral part of the
city. It is particularly associated with the brother of Arcadius,
the enervated Honorius, who ruled the Western Empire for
more than thirty years, an effigy rather than the reality of a
king. Thus the Forum of Honorius constitutes its market-place,
and its public baths are also distinguished by the name
of the same prince. It possesses, moreover, a dock and a
church with gilded tiles, and is fortified in the usual way by
a wall with towers.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81"> 81</span></p>

<p>Rome was divided by Augustus into fourteen regions or
parishes, to each of which he appointed a body of public
officers whose functions much resembled those of a modern
Vestry.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> The municipal government of the new Rome is an
almost exact imitation of that instituted by the founder of
the Empire for the old capital. Here are the same number
of regions, named numerically and counted in order from
east to west, beginning at the end of the promontory. The
last two of these, however, are outside the wall of Constantine,
that is to say, Blachernae on the north-west and Sycae
over the water. To each division is assigned a <i>Curator</i> or
chief controller, a <i>Vernaculus</i> or beadle, who performs the
duties of a public herald, five <i>Vicomagistri</i>, who form a night
patrol for the streets, and a considerable number of <i>Collegiati</i>,
in the tenth region as many as ninety, whose duty
it is to rush to the scene of fires with hatchets and water-buckets.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
At night the main thoroughfares are well lighted
by flaring oil-lamps.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>One remarkable feature of the city, to be encountered by
the visitor at every turn, is an elevated shed which can be approached
on all sides by ranges of steps. These “Steps,” as
they are briefly called, are stations for the gratuitous daily
distribution of provisions to the poorer citizens. Every morning
a concourse of the populace repairs to the Step attached
to their district, and each person, on presenting a wooden
<i>tessera</i> or ticket, inscribed with certain amounts, receives a
supply of bread, and also a dole of oil, wine, and flesh.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82"> 82</span>
More than six score of such stations are scattered throughout
the town, and the necessary corn is stored in large
granaries which are for the most part replenished by ships
arriving every season from Alexandria.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> More than twenty
public bakeries furnish daily the required demand of bread.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
Besides free grants of food and houses for the entertainment
of strangers, the city contains various other charities under
the direction of state officials, the chief of which are hospitals
for the sick and aged, orphanages, poor-houses, and institutions
for the reception of foundlings.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> A medical officer,
entitled an arch-physician, with a public stipend, is attached
to each parish to attend gratuitously to the poor.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>The civic authorities are well aware that disease arises
from putrid effluvia, and hence an elaborate system of deep
drainage has been constructed so that all sewage is carried
by multiple channels into the sea.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Since the introduction of
Christianity, cremation has become obsolete, and burial in the
earth is universally practised.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> Public cemeteries, however,
are not allowed within the walls, but churches and monasteries
are permitted to devote a portion of their precincts to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83"> 83</span>
the purpose of interment. Such limited space is necessarily
reserved for members of the hierarchy and persons of a certain
rank, who have been beneficiaries of the church or order.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>We may here terminate our exploration of the topography
of Constantinople, content to leave a multitude of objects,
both interesting and important, beyond the limits of our
survey. Were I to attempt the description of everything
worthy of notice in the city, my exposition would soon resemble
the catalogue of a museum, and the reader’s attention would
expire under the sense of interminable enumerations. Our
picture has been filled in with sufficient detail to convey the
impression of a vast capital laid out in colonnaded squares
and streets, to the adornment of which all that Grecian art
could evolve in architecture and statuary has been applied
with a lavishness attainable only by the fiat of a wide-ruling
despot.</p>


<h3 id="section_III">III. <span class="smcap">Sociology</span></h3>

<p>To make this chapter fully consonant to its title it now
remains for us to pass in review the sociological condition
of the inhabitants, whilst we try to learn something of their
mode of life, their national characteristics, and their mental
aptitudes. We have already seen that in the case of the
Neo-Byzantines or Lesser Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> the path of evolution lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84"> 84</span>
through a series of historical vicissitudes in which there was
more of artificial forcing than of the insensible growth essential
to the formation of a homogeneous people. Owing to
its geographical position it was perhaps inevitable from the
first that Byzantium should become a cosmopolitan town,
whose population should develop little political stability or
patriotic coherence. In addition, however, it happened that
the Megareans, their chief progenitors, had gained an unenviable
notoriety throughout Greece; they were generally
esteemed to be gluttonous, slothful, ineffective, and curiously
prolific in courtesans, who, for some reason which now
escapes us, were peculiarly styled “Megarean sphinxes.”<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
Once established on the Golden Horn the Byzantines seem
to have found life very easy; their fisheries were inexhaustible
and facile beyond belief;<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> whilst the merchants trading in
those seas soon flocked thither so that port dues furnished
an unearned and considerable income. As a consequence
the bulk of the populace spent their time idling in the market-place
or about the wharves, each one assured of meeting
some visitor to whom for a valuable consideration he was
willing to let his house and even his wife, whilst he himself
took up his abode in the more congenial wine-shop. So
firmly did this dissolute mode of life gain a footing, that
when the town was besieged the citizens could not be rallied
to defend the walls until the municipal authorities had set
up drinking-booths on the ramparts.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Law was usually in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85"> 85</span>
abeyance,<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> finance disorganized,<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> and political independence
forfeit to the leading power of the moment, whether Greek
or Persian.</p>

<p>Such was the community whose possession of a matchless
site decided Constantine to select them as the nucleus of
population for his new Rome, the meditated capital of the
East. And, in order to fill with life and movement the streets
newly laid out, he engrafted on this doubtful stock a multitude
of servile and penurious immigrants, whom he allured
from their native haunts by the promise of free residence and
rations.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Nevertheless a metropolis constituted from such
elements was scarcely below the level of the times, and was
destined to prove a successful rival of the degenerate Rome
which Constantine aspired to supplant.</p>

<p>The impressions of life and colour which affect a stranger
on entering a new city arise in great part from the costume
of its inhabitants. At Constantinople there prevails in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86"> 86</span>
age a decency in dress foreign to Rome during the first centuries
of the Empire, and even to Greece in the most classic
period. Ladies invested with garments of such tenuity as to
reveal more than they conceal of their physical beauties, to
the confusion of some contemporary Seneca, are not here to
be met with in the streets;<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> the Athenian maiden, with her
tunic divided almost to the hip, or the Spartan virgin displaying
her limbs bare to the middle of the thigh, have no
reflection under the piazzas of renascent Byzantium. A new
modesty, born of Christian influences, has cast a mantle of
uniformity over the licence as well as over the simplicity of
the pagan world. In observing the costume of this time a
modern eye would first, perhaps, note the fact that in civil
life the garb of men differs but little from that of women.
Loose clothing, which hides the shape of the body, and in
general the whole of the lower limbs, is common to both
sexes. Men usually shave, but a moustache is often worn;
their hair is cropped, but not very close.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Head-gear is an
exception, and so, for the lower classes, are coverings for the
feet. A workman, an artisan, or a slave, the latter a numerous
class, wears a simple tunic of undyed wool, short-sleeved,
girt round the waist and reaching to the knees, with probably
a hood which can be drawn over the head as a protection
against the weather.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> This garment is in fact the foundation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87"> 87</span>
dress of all ranks of men, but the rich wear fine materials,
often of silk and of varied hues, have long sleeves, and use
girdles of some costly stuff. They, in addition, are invested
in handsome cloaks reaching to the ankles, which are open
for their whole length on the right side and are secured by
a jewelled clasp over the corresponding shoulder. Shoes
often highly ornamented,<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> and long hose, coloured according
to taste, complete the dress of an ordinary Byzantine gentleman.
On less formal occasions a short sleeveless cloak,
fastened at the neck, but open down the front, is the
customary outer vestment. The tunic or gown of women
reaches to the feet, and, in the case of ladies, is embroidered
or woven with designs of various patterns and tints. The
latter usually consist of some small variegated device which
is repeated in oblique lines all over the garment. Shawls,
somewhat similar in colour and texture to the gown, thrown
over the back and shoulders or wound round the bust, are
habitually worn at the same time. Gloves, shoes and stockings
of various hues, and a simple form of cap which partly
conceals the hair, are also essential to the attire of a Byzantine
lady. As in all ages, jewellery is much coveted, and women of
any social rank are rarely to be seen without heavy necklaces,
earrings of an elaborate spreading design,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> and golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88"> 88</span>
girdles.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> A less numerous class of the community are male
ascetics, celibates of a puritanical cast, who love to placard
themselves by wearing scarlet clothing and binding their
hair with a fillet;<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> also virgins devoted to the service of the
churches, who are known by their sombre dress, black
hoods, gray mantles, and black shoes.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> Philosophers adopt
gray, rhetoricians crimson, and physicians blue, for the tint
of their cloaks.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> To these may be added the courtesans who
try to usurp the costume of every grade of women, even that
of the sacred sisterhood.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Such is the population who usually
crowd the thoroughfares and lend them a gaudy aspect
which is still further heightened by numbers of private
carriages—literally springless carts—bedizened with paint
and gilding, and most fashionable if drawn by a pair of
white mules with golden trappings. Such vehicles are indispensable
to the outdoor movements of matrons of any rank;<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89"> 89</span>
and in each case a train of eunuchs in gorgeous liveries, and
decked with ornaments of gold, mark the progress of a great
lady.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> Occasionally we may see the Praefect of the City, or
some other man of signal rank, passing in a silver wagon
drawn by four horses yoked abreast.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Often we meet a noble
riding a white horse, his saddle-cloth embroidered in gold;
around him a throng of attendants bearing rods of office
with which they rudely scatter all meaner citizens to make
way for their haughty master.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> A person of any consequence
perambulating the city is followed by at least one slave
bearing a folding seat for incidental rest.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> In some retired
nook we may encounter a circle of the populace gazing intently
at the performance of a street mountebank; he juggles
with cups and goblets; pipes, dances, and sings a lewd
ballad; the bystanders reward him with a morsel of bread
or an obole; he invokes a thousand blessings on their heads,
and departs to resume his display in some other spot.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>The Byzantine Emperor and Empress are distinguished
in dress from all their subjects by the privilege of wearing
the Imperial purple.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> The Emperor is further denoted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90"> 90</span>
his jewelled shoes or slippers of a bright scarlet colour, a
feature in his apparel which is even more exclusive than his
cloak or his crown. The latter symbol of majesty is a broad
black hoop expanding towards the top, bordered above and
below with a row of pearls, thickly studded with gems all
round, and bearing four great pendent pearls which fall in
pairs on the nape of the neck. His ample purple robe,
which falls to his feet, is fastened by a costly shoulder-clasp
of precious stones. Its uniformity is diversified by two
squares or tables of cloth of gold embroidered in various
colours, which approach from the back and front the division
on the right side. Purple hose and a white tunic, sleeved to
the wrists and girt with a crimson scarf, complete the civil
attire of the Emperor. When sitting in state he usually
bears a globe surmounted by a cross<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> in his left hand. His
attendant nobles, a new order of patricians who are styled
the Fathers of the Emperor,<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> are garbed all in white, but the
tables of their gowns are of plain purple, their girdles are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91"> 91</span>
red, and their shoes are black. His Protectors or guards
wear green tunics, with red facings, and are shod in black
with white hose; a thick ring of gold, joined to a secondary
oval one in front, encircles the neck of each one; they are
armed with a long spear, and carry an oval shield bordered
with blue and widely starred from the centre in black on
a red ground. Their Count or Captain is distinguished by
a red and purple breasted tunic, and by the Christian monogram
of his shield in yellow on a green ground. The dress
of the Empress is very similar to that of her consort, but her
crown is more imposing, being heightened by sprays of
jewels, and laden with strings of pearls which fall over her
neck and shoulders.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Her purple mantle is without tables,
but is brocaded with gold figures around the skirt; she wears
besides an under-skirt embroidered in bright hues, golden
slippers with green hose, and all jewels proper to ladies of
the most costly description.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Two or three patricians usually
wait on the Empress, but her Court is chiefly composed of
a bevy of noble matrons or maids, female patricians who
act as her tire-women; the leader<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> of these is distinguished
by her purple gown.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92"> 92</span></p>

<p>Every morning at seven o’clock the Grand Janitor of the
Palace,<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> taking his bunch of keys, proceeds with a company
of guards and Silentiaries to open all the doors which lead
from the Augusteum to the Consistorium. After the lapse of
an hour the Primicerius or captain of the watch knocks at
the door of the Emperor’s private apartments. Surrounded
by his eunuchs the prince then sallies forth and first, standing
before an image of Christ in a reverential attitude,
recites a formal prayer. On the completion of this pious
office he takes his seat on the throne and calls for the Logothete<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
or steward of the royal household. Upon this the
Janitor, pushing aside the variegated curtains which close
the door leading to the antechamber, passes out, and in
a short time returns with the desired official. The Logothete
first drops on one knee and adores the majesty of the
Emperor, after which he rises and transaction of business
for the day begins. By this time the antechamber of the
Throne room has become crowded with dignitaries of state,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93"> 93</span>
patricians, senators, praefects, and logothetes of various
denominations. The Emperor commands the presence from
time to time of such of these as he wishes to confer with,
and all of them at their first entrance salute him with the
same form of submissive obeisance, except those of patrician
rank, who merely bow profoundly, and are greeted by the
Emperor with a kiss.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Codicils or commissions for the
appointment of officers of state or rulers of provinces are
presented by the Master of the Rolls,<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> and the Emperor
signs the documents in purple ink, the use of which is forbidden
to subjects.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Such codicils are illustrated in colours
with various devices symbolical of the dignity or duties of
the office conferred. Those of praefects and proconsuls of
the highest rank display a draped <i>abacus</i> or table on which
rests a framed image of the Emperor lighted by wax tapers;
in addition, busts of the Emperor with his imperial associates
or heirs on a pedestal, and a silver quadriga—insignia
of office, which adorn the local vestibule or denote the
vicegerent of the sovereign in his progress through the
public ways. The provinces or districts are indicated by
female figures or busts labelled with various names; in
many instances by rivers, mountains, indigenous animals,
and miniature fortresses representing the chief towns. In
the case of rulers of lesser rank—dukes, vicars, correctors,
counts, presidents—a portly volume inscribed with the
initials of a conventional sentence<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> supplants the painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94"> 94</span>
image. For Masters of the Forces the codicils are illustrated
with weapons of war or with the numerous designs, geometrical
or pictorial, which distinguish the shields of the
cohorts under their command. Dignitaries of civil rank,
financial or secretarial, are suitably denoted on their diplomas
by vessels loaded with coin, purses, writing-cases, and rolls
of manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> In addition to those assigning administrative
appointments honorary codicils are also issued, by
which the prerogative or precedence only pertaining to
various ranks is conferred. These documents are also called
“nude,” as they are not illustrated with those figures which
indicate that the holder is in authority over particular districts.
They are equivalent to patents of nobility, and are
granted for service to the state, general esteem, and probably
also by mere purchase.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Among the throng at the Emperor’s
receptions are always a number of officers of a certain rank,
who, on vacating their posts, have the privilege of waiting
on the Emperor in order to adore or kiss his purple.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> In the
absence of urgent business the audience closes at ten o’clock;
at a sign from the Emperor the Janitor passes into the antechamber
with his keys, which he agitates noisily as a signal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95"> 95</span>
of dismissal. The Palace is then shut up, but at two o’clock
it is reopened with the same formalities for the further transaction
of affairs. At five o’clock it is again closed and the
routine of Imperial reception is at an end for the day. On
the <i>Dominica</i> or Sunday the assembly is most numerous,
and the company repairs in procession to one of the adjoining
halls to attend the performance of a brief divine service.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
As a concession to the holiness of this day adoration of the
Emperor is less formal. When the Emperor or Empress
drives through the streets the carriage is drawn by four
white horses or mules,<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> the vehicle and the trappings of the
animals being ornate in the highest degree.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Public processions
on festal days of the Church are regular and frequent;
and on these occasions, as well as on those of national rejoicing,
the Emperor rides a white horse amidst his train of eunuchs,
nobles, and guards. At such times the Praefect of the City
enjoins a special cleansing and decoration of the streets on
the prescribed route. The way is adorned from end to end
with myrtle, rosemary, ivy, box, and flowers of all kinds
which are in bloom at the season. The air is filled with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96"> 96</span>
odour of incense, and from private windows and balconies
particoloured and embroidered fabrics are suspended by the
inhabitants. Wherever the royal cavalcade passes, cries of
“Long live the Emperor” rise from every throat.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> At night
the thoroughfares are illuminated by frequent lamps displayed
from windows and doorways. But on occasions of
public calamity, such as ruinous earthquakes or prolonged
drought, this scene of splendour is reversed; and the
Emperor, on foot and uncrowned, proceeds amidst the
clergy and populace, all clad in sombre garments, to one of
the sacred shrines outside the walls to offer up supplications
for a remission of the scourge.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> And again the Emperor
may be seen as a humble pedestrian, whilst the Patriarch,
who usually rides upon an ass, is seated in the Imperial
carriage, on his way to the consecration of a new church, or
holding on his knees the relics of some saint prior to their
deposition in one of the sacred edifices.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>At this date conventional titles of distinction or adulation
have attained to the stage of full development. The Emperor,
in Greek <i>Basileus</i> or <i>Autocrator</i>, the sole Augustus,
is also styled Lord and Master, and is often addressed as
“Your Clemency.”<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> His appointed heir receives the dignity
of Caesar and perhaps the title of <i>Nobilissimus</i>, an epithet
confined to the nearest associates of the throne.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Below the
Imperial eminence and its attachments the great officers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97"> 97</span>
state are disposed in three ranks, namely, the <i>Illustres</i>,
<i>Spectabiles</i>, and <i>Clarissimi</i>. The Illustrious dignitaries are
termed by the Prince and others “Most Glorious,” and are
variously addressed as “Your Sublimity,” “Magnificence,”
“Eminence,” “Excellence,” “Highness,” “Serenity,” or
“Sincerity,” etc. The two lower ranks are similarly addressed,
but only the less fulsome of such expressions are
applied to them. Consonant to the same scheme the clergy
receive the epithets of “Most Holy,” “Blessed,” “Reverend,”
“Beloved of God”; and are addressed as “Your Beatitude,”
“Eminence,” etc., the emphasis being graduated
according as they may happen to be Patriarchs, Archbishops,
Metropolitans, Bishops, or simple clericals.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>In the assemblies of the Hippodrome popular fervour
reaches its highest pitch, whether in times of festive or
political excitement. From Daphne, by the gallery of St.
Stephen’s and the Cochlea, the Emperor, surrounded by
courtiers and guards, gains his throne in the Kathisma.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> On
his entry the Protectors, already assembled in the Stama or
Pi, elevate the Standards which have previously been lying
on the ground.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Before seating himself on his throne the
Emperor, advancing to the balustrade of the Kathisma,
greets the assembled populace by making the sign of the
cross in the air. As soon as the answering cries of adulation
subside, a set hymn<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> is intoned from each side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98"> 98</span>
Circus in alternate responsions by particular bodies of the
people called <i>Demes</i>, whose importance, not merely agonistic,
but above all political, renders a special account of them
here necessary.</p>

<p>The Demes or factionaries of the Hippodrome occupy the
benches at the end of the arena on each side adjacent to the
Kathisma,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> and are called the <i>Veneti</i> and <i>Prasini</i>, that is,
the Blues and Greens.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> These bodies, which are legally incorporated
as guilds,<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> consist of the contending parties in
the chariot races, and of such others as elect to enroll themselves
as their followers, and to wear the colours of the
respective sides. Each Deme has a subdivision, or rather, a
pendant, to which the colours white and red are attached
respectively.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> The chief or president of each faction is entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99"> 99</span>
the Demarch.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> These two parties form cabals in the
state, who are animated by a fierce rivalry engendering an
intensely factious disposition. Every consideration is subordinated
to a strained sense of personal or party honour,
whence is evolved a generally uncompromising defiance to
the restrictions of law and order. Ties of blood and friendship
are habitually set at naught by the insolent clanship of
these factions; even women, although excluded from the
spectacles of the Circus, are liable to become violent partisans
of either colour, and that in opposition sometimes to the
affinities of their own husbands and families. Nor does the
Emperor by an equal distribution of his favours seek to control
the intemperate rivalry of the Demes, but usually becomes
the avowed patron of a particular faction.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> At the present
time the Greens are in the ascendant, and fill the benches to
the left of the Kathisma, a position of honour assigned to
them by the younger Theodosius.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> Every town of any magnitude
has a Circus with its Blue and Green factions, and these
parties are in sympathetic correspondence throughout the
Empire.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>The throng of spectators within the Hippodrome, who can
be accommodated with seats around the arena, amounts to
about 40,000, but this number falls far short of the whole
mass of the populace eager to witness the exhibition. From
early dawn men of all ages, even if maimed or crippled,
assault the gates; and when the interior is filled to repletion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100"> 100</span>
the excluded multitude betake themselves to every post of
vantage in the vicinity which overlooks the Circus. Then
windows and roofs of houses, hill-tops and adjacent eminences
of all kinds are seized on by determined pleasure seekers.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>Public entertainments are given regularly in the Hippodrome
and the theatre during the first week of January, in
celebration of the Consul being newly installed for the year.
They are given also on the 11th of May, the foundation day
of the city, and on other occasions to celebrate some great
national event, such as the accession of an emperor, the fifth
or tenth anniversary of his reign,<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> the birth or nomination of
a Caesar or successor to the throne, or the happy termination
of an important war.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Several Praetors, officers who were
formerly the chief oracles of the law, are nominated annually,
their judicial functions being now abrogated in favour of
organizing and paying for the amusements of the people.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101"> 101</span></p>

<p>Twelve chariot races take place in the morning, and, after
an interval of retirement, a similar number in the afternoon;<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
between the races other exhibitions are introduced, especially
fights of men with lions, tigers, and bears,<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> rope walking,<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> and
matches of boxing and wrestling.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> In the contests between
two-or four-horse chariots, the competitors make the circuit
of the arena seven times, whence the whole length of the
course traversed amounts to about a mile and a half.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> The
start is made from the top of the Euripus on the right-hand
side, where a rope is stretched across to keep the horses in
line after their exit from the Manganon, until the signal is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102"> 102</span>
given by the dropping of a white cloth or <i>mappa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> The races
are run with great fury, and the charioteers, standing in their
vehicles, make every effort to win, not merely by speed, but
by fouling each other so as to pass in front or gain the inmost
position of the circuit. Hence serious and fatal accidents are
of habitual occurrence, and help to stimulate the popular
frenzy to the highest pitch.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> The antagonists, however, pay
but little attention to the clamours of the spectators, looking
only to the Emperor’s eye for their meed of approval or
censure.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> At the conclusion of the games, amid the chanting
of various responsions by the factions and the populace, the
victors, supported by delegates from the four Demes bearing
crosses woven from fresh flowers, wait upon the Emperor in
the Kathisma, and receive from his hand the awards of their
prowess.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103"> 103</span></p>

<p>Less frequently the Circus may be contemplated under a
more serious aspect, as the focus of national agitation. In
the year 491, during Easter week, Constantinople was thrown
into a great commotion by a report that the Emperor Zeno
had died somewhat suddenly,<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> and that no successor had yet
been nominated for the throne. The people, the Demes, and
the Imperial guards at once rushed to the Hippodrome,
where all took up the stations allotted to them for viewing the
Circensian games. On all sides an incessant clamour then
arose, and the cry, addressed to those in authority, was
vociferously repeated: “Give an Emperor to the Romans.”
Simultaneously the great officers of the Court, the Senate,
and the Patriarch assembled hastily within the Palace in
order to decide on what course to pursue. In this convention
the counsel of the chief eunuch Urbicius, Grand Chamberlain,
had most weight; and, fearing a riot, it was resolved that
the Empress Ariadne, on whose popularity they relied, should
proceed immediately to the Kathisma, and, by a suitable
address, attempt to pacify the populace. On the appearance
of the Empress in the Hippodrome, with the retinue of her
supreme rank, the clamours were redoubled. Exclamations
arose from every throat: “Ariadne Augusta, may you be
victorious! Lord have mercy on us! Long live the Augusta!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104"> 104</span>
Give an orthodox Emperor to the Romans, to all the earth!”
The widow of Zeno addressed the multitude at some length,
by the mouth of a crier, who read her speech from a written
document. “Every consideration,” said she, “shall be shown
to the majesty of the people. We have referred the matter to
the Lords of the Court, to the Sacred Senate, and to the
Heads of the Army; nor shall the presence of the Holy
Patriarch be wanting to render the election valid. An orthodox
Emperor shall be given to you and one of blameless life.
Restrain yourselves for the present and be careful not to
disturb the tranquillity of our choice.” With such promises
and exhortations, often interrupted, Ariadne left the Circus
amid the renewed shouts of the vast assembly. Within the
Palace the council was reformed, and, after some debate,
Urbicius carried his proposition that the election of an Emperor
should be referred to the widowed Empress. Upon this
Ariadne put forward a much respected officer of the Court,
the Silentiary Anastasius, a man of about sixty years of age.
Her nominee was about to be accepted unanimously when
the Patriarch interposed his authority and demanded that
Anastasius should give him an engagement to uphold the
orthodox faith. The Silentiary was, in fact, suspected of a
strong leaning towards the monophysite heresy, which declared
that Christ was possessed of only one nature.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> His proposition
was entertained, and thereupon a guard of honour was
sent to summon Anastasius from his house, and to escort him
to the Palace; but before any formal question was put they all
set about performing the obsequies of the deceased Emperor
Zeno. The next day Anastasius presided in the Consistorium
to receive the officers of state, all of whom waited on him clad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105"> 105</span>
in white robes. He subscribed the document as required by
the Patriarch, and took an oath to administer the Empire
with a true conscience. He was then conducted to the
Hippodrome, where he appeared in the undress of an emperor,
but wearing the red buskins. Amid the acclamations of the
populace he was exalted on a buckler, and a military officer
crowned him with a golden collar removed from his own
person.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Anastasius then retired to the antechamber of the
Kathisma to be invested, by the Patriarch himself, with the
Imperial purple, and to have a jewelled crown placed upon
his head. Again he sought the presence of the assembled
multitude, whom he addressed in a set speech which was read
out to them by a crier. Finally the newly-elected Autocrator
departed to the Palace amid repeated cries of “God bless
our Christian Emperor! You have lived virtuously, Reign as
you have lived!”<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>But the proceedings in the Hippodrome were not always
merely pleasurable or peacefully political. The Circus was
also the place where sedition was carried to the culminating
point; and the same Anastasius, in his long reign of twenty-seven
years, had to experience on more than one occasion
the fickle humour of the Byzantine populace. About 498,
during the progress of the games, a cry arose that certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106"> 106</span>
rioters, who had been committed to prison for throwing stones
inside the arena, should be liberated. The Emperor refused,
a tumult arose, and the Imperial guards were ordered to
arrest the apparent instigators of the disorder. Stones were
immediately flung at Anastasius himself, who only escaped
injury or death by his precipitate flight from the Kathisma.
The mob then set fire to the wooden benches of the
Hippodrome, and a conflagration ensued, which consumed
part of the Imperial Palace in one direction, and ravaged a
large tract of the city as far as the Forum of Constantine on
the other.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Again in 512, when the Emperor, yielding to his
heretical tendencies to confound the persons of the Trinity,
proclaimed that in future the Trisagion<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> should be chanted
with the addition “Who wast crucified for us,” the populace
rose in a fury, set fire to the houses of many persons who were
obnoxious to them, decapitated a monk suspected of suggesting
the heresy, and, marching through the streets with his
head upon a pole, demanded that “another Emperor should
be given to the Romans.” Anastasius, affrighted, rushed into
the Hippodrome without his crown, and protested his
willingness to abdicate the purple. The spectacle, however,
of their Emperor in such an abject state appeased the excited
throng, and, on the withdrawal of the offensive phrase, peace
was restored to the community.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107"> 107</span></p>

<p>The Byzantine theatre, in which there are usually diurnal
performances,<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> is by no means a lineal descendant of that of
the Greeks and Romans. The names of Aeschylus, Sophocles,
and the rest of those inimitable playwrights, are either
altogether unknown, or are heard with complete indifference.
Pantomime, farce, lewd songs, and dances in which troops
of females<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> virtually dispense with clothing, monopolize the
stage to the exclusion of the classic drama. Ribaldry and
obscenity, set off by spectacular displays,<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> constitute the
essence of the entertainment; and women even go through
the form of bathing in a state of nudity for the delectation
of the audience.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> A contemporary music-hall, without its
enforced decency, would probably convey to a modern
reader the most correct impression of the stage as maintained
in Christian Constantinople. Actress and prostitute are
synonymous terms, and all persons engaged in the theatrical
profession are regarded in the eye of the law as vile and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108"> 108</span>
disreputable.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Nevertheless, the pastimes of the public are
jealously protected; and the amorous youth who runs away
with an actress,<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> equally with him who withdraws a favourite
horse from the Circensian games for his private use,<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> is
subjected to a heavy fine. A woman, however, who wishes
to reform her life on the plea of religious conviction, is
permitted to quit the stage, but is not afterwards allowed to
relapse into her former life of turpitude.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Should she betray
any inclination to do so, it is enacted that she shall be kept
in a place of detention until such time as the decrepitude of
age shall afford an involuntary guarantee of her chastity.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
The Byzantine aristocracy, from the rank of Clarissimus
upwards is prohibited from marrying an actress or any
woman on a level with that class.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109"> 109</span></p>

<p>A particular form of amusement among the Byzantines is
the installation of a Consul every year on the Calends of
January in imitation of the old republican function at Rome.
The person nominated assumes a gorgeous robe decorated
with purple stripes and gold embroidery,<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> grasps a sceptre
surmounted with a figure of Victory,<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> and proceeds in state
to the Hippodrome, where he displays his authority by
manumitting a number of slaves specially provided for the
purpose.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> He presides at the games from the Kathisma, and
for the moment, if not the Emperor himself, as frequently
happens, the pretence is made of regarding him as the
sovereign of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> The year is legally distinguished
by his name and that of his colleague of the West,<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> a series
of public spectacles are exhibited for seven days,<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> he scatters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110"> 110</span>
golden coin as largess among the citizens,<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> and emissaries are
dispatched in all directions throughout the provinces to
announce his elevation,<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> and to deposit in the local archives
his diptychs, a pair of ivory plates inscribed with his likeness
or insignia.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Immediately afterwards, the office relapses into
a sinecure, and the Consul resumes his ordinary avocations
in life.</p>

<p>On Sunday there is a cessation of business and pleasure
throughout the city, though not of agricultural labour in the
rural districts.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> At the boom of the great <i>semantron</i>,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> a
sonorous board suspended in the porch of each church, and
beaten with mallets by a deacon, the various congregations
issue forth to attend their respective places of worship. In
the forecourt they are met by a crowd of mendicants, exemplifying
every degree of poverty and every form of bodily
infirmity, who enjoy a prescriptive right to solicit alms at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111"> 111</span>
time and place. This practice has, in fact, been encouraged
by the early Fathers of the Church, in order that the heart
may be melted to pity and philanthropy at the sight of so
much human misery as the most fitting preparation for the
order of divine service.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> The centre of the same inclosure
is occupied by a fountain of pure water, in which it is
customary to wash the hands before entering the sacred
edifice.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> In the narthex or vestibule, in a state of abject
contrition, are found the various penitents, who, for some
offence, have been cut off from the communion of the
faithful, condemned to advance no farther than this part for
a term of years proportionate to the heinousness of their
sin.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> The males of the congregation make use of the central
or Beautiful Gate of the church, in order to gain their station
in the nave, whilst the females, passing through the doors on
each side, ascend to the galleries which are set apart for their
special accommodation.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> The liturgy consists of reading from
the Scriptures, of prayers, and of hymns sung in responses;<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
after which the Patriarch, coming forward from his throne in
the apse to the ambo,<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> preaches a homily based on some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112"> 112</span>
portion of the Bible. Finally the Eucharist is administered
to the whole congregation, a spoon being used to give a
portion of wine to each person.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Ladies, to attend public
worship, bedeck themselves with all their jewels and finery,<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
whence female thieves, mingling amongst them, often take
the opportunity to reap their harvest.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> Men, in the most
obvious manner, betray their admiration for the women placed
within their range of vision.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> The general behaviour of the
audience is more suggestive of a place of amusement than of
a holy temple; chattering and laughter go on continually,
especially among the females; and, as a popular preacher
makes his points, dealing didactically or reprehensively with
topics of the day, the whole congregation is from time to time
agitated with polemical murmurs, shaken with laughter, or
bursts into uproarious applause.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Contiguous to each church
is a small building called the Baptistery, for the performance
of the ceremonial entailed on those who wish to be received
among the Christian elect. The practice of the period is to
subject the body to complete immersion in pure water, but
separate chambers or times are set apart for the convenience
of the two sexes. Here on certain occasions nude females of
all ages and ranks descend by steps into the baptismal font,
whilst the ecclesiastics coldly pronounce the formulas of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113"> 113</span>
mystic rite,<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> a triumph of superstition<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> over concupiscence
pretended more often perhaps than real.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>The luxury of the rich, especially in the use of the precious
metals and ivory, is in this age maintained at the
maximum. Practically all the furniture in the house of a
wealthy man, as far at least as the visible parts are concerned,
is constructed of those costly materials. Gilding or plates of
gold or silver are applied to every available surface—to
tables, chairs, footstools, and bedsteads; even silver night-urns
are essential to the comfort of the fastidious plutocracy.<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
For banqueting the Byzantines make use of a large semicircular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114"> 114</span>
table,<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> on the convex side of which they recline at
meals, still adhering to the custom of the earlier Greeks
and Romans.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> By this table is set a ponderous gold vase
with goblets of the same metal for mixing and serving out
the wine. Rich carpets are strewn over the mosaic pavement;
and troops of servants, either eunuchs or of barbarian
origin, permeate the mansion.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> These domestics are costumed
and adorned as expensively as are their masters, and
in the largest establishments are retained to the number of
one or two thousand.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> Like animals they are bought and
sold; and, male and female alike, are as much the property
of their owner as his ordinary goods and chattels; their life
is virtually in his hands, but the growth of humanity under
the Empire, and the tenets of Stoicism,<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> have considerably
ameliorated their condition since the time of the old Republic.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
In this, as in every other age, the artificial forms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115"> 115</span>
politeness, which spring up as the inseparable concomitant
of every aspect of civilization, have developed in social
circles; and the various formalities and affectations of
manners and speech familiar to the modern observer as
characteristic of the different grades of society may be noted
among the Constantinopolitans.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>The Byzantine wife is in possession of complete liberty
of action, and is entirely the mistress in her own household.
She is, as a rule, devoted to enervating luxury and enjoyments,
which she gratifies by extravagance in dress and
jewels, by the use of costly unguents and the artificial tinting
of her countenance,<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> and by daily visits to the public baths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116"> 116</span>
and squares for the purpose of display and gossip.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> At home
she is often a tyrant to her maidservants, and not infrequently
whips them severely with her own hand.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Precisely
the reverse of this picture is the condition of the Byzantine
maiden in her father’s house; before her coverture she is
persistently immured in the women’s apartments, and seldom
passes the outer door of the dwelling; never unless
under strict surveillance.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> In most instances, however, her
state of seclusion is not of long duration; for, at the age of
fourteen or fifteen she is considered to be marriageable.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117"> 117</span>
then becomes an article of traffic in the hands of the professional
match-maker, who is usually an old woman of low
social grade, but remarkable for her tactful and deceptive
aptitudes.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> By her arts a suitable family alliance is arranged,
but unless by a subterfuge, the proposed husband is not
permitted to behold his future wife.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>Once a marriage has been decided on,<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> it is considered
fitting that all the innocence of the ingenuous damsel should
be put to flight on the threshold of the wedded state. In
the dusk of the evening the bride is fetched from her home
by a torchlight procession to the sound of pipes and flutes
and orgiastic songs. Although women are not allowed to
attend the theatre, on this occasion the theatre is brought to
the houses of the contracting parties; and the installation of
a wife takes place amid a scene of riot and debauchery, of
lewdness and obscenity, which tears the veil from all the
secrets of sexual co-habitation.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118"> 118</span></p>

<p>Mental culture, even in the mansions of wealthy Byzantines,
occupies a very subordinate place. Everywhere
may be seen dice and draughts, but books are usually conspicuous
by their absence. Bibliophiles there are, however, but
they merely cherish costly bindings and beautiful manuscripts,
and seldom take the trouble to study their literary contents.
They only value fine parchments dyed in various tints,
especially purple, and handsomely inscribed with letters of
gold or silver; these they delight to have bound in jewelled
covers or in plates of carved ivory, and to preserve them in
cabinets, whence they are drawn out on occasion in order
to afford a proof of the taste and affluence of the owner.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>Popular superstitions are extremely rife at this time in the
Orient; a few examples of such may be here given. In
choosing a name for a child it is the practice to light a
number of candles, and to christen them by various names;
the candle which burns longest is then selected to convey
its appellation to the infant as an earnest of long life.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
Another custom is to take a baby to one of the public baths
and to sign its forehead with some of the sedimental mud
found there as a charm against the evil eye and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119"> 119</span>
powers of enchantment.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> Amulets are commonly worn, hung
about the neck, and of these, miniature copies of the Gospels
are in great favour, especially for the protection of infants.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
Should a merchant on his way to business for the day first
meet with a sacred virgin, he curses his luck and anticipates
a bad issue to any pending negotiations; on the contrary,
should the first woman he encounters be a prostitute, he
rejoices in the auspicious omen with which his day has
opened.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> At funerals the old Roman custom of hiring
females to act as mourners, who keep up a discordant wailing
and shed tears copiously at will, is still maintained.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
Black clothes are worn as a mark of sorrow for the dead.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
Great extravagance is often shown in the erection of handsome
sepulchral monuments.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>That the capital of the East, and by inference the whole
Empire, is a hotbed of vice and immorality will impress
itself on the mind of the most superficial reader. The dissoluteness
of youth is in fact so appalling that the most sane of
fathers resort to the extreme measure of expelling their sons
from home in a penniless state, with the view that after a
term of trial and hardship they may return as reformed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120"> 120</span>
chastened members to the family circle.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Yet to complete
the picture one other sin against morality must be mentioned,
which travels beyond the belief and almost eludes the conception
of any ordinary mind. The incredible perversion of
sexual instinct named paederasty is still more than ever rife
in the principal cities of the East. Idealized by the Greek
philosophers,<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> tolerated by the later Republic,<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> and almost
deified<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> under many of the pagan emperors,<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> it has withstood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121"> 121</span>
the pronouncements of Trajan and Alexander,<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> the
diatribes of the Christian Fathers,<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> and even the laws of
Constantius and Valentinian, by which such delinquents are
condemned to be burnt alive.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Preaching at Antioch a
century before this time, the earnest and fearless Chrysostom
cannot refrain from expressing his amazement that that
metropolis, in its open addiction to this vice, does not meet
with the biblical fate of Sodom and Gomorrah.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> Nor is
there any evidence to refute the assumption that Constantinople
at the beginning of the sixth century is in this
respect less impure than the Syrian capital.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122"> 122</span></p>

<p>The Byzantine coinage, which has been recast by Anastasius,
consists of gold, silver, and copper. The standard
gold coin, the <i>aureus</i> or <i>solidus</i>, subdivides the pound<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> of
gold into seventy-two equal parts, and is, therefore, to be
valued at nearly twelve English shillings. Halves and thirds
of the <i>aureus</i> are regularly minted for circulation. There is
also a silver <i>solidus</i> which weighs nearly fifteen times as
much as that of gold.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Twelfths, twenty-fourths, and forty-eighths
of this coin are issued; they are named the <i>milliaresion</i>,
the <i>siliqua</i>, and the <i>half-siliqua</i> respectively. In the
copper coinage at the head of the list stands the <i>follis</i>, two
hundred and ten of which are contained in the <i>solidus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>
Hence the <i>milliaresion</i> is not much less in value than a
shilling, whilst the <i>follis</i> represents but little more than a
halfpenny. Yet the <i>follis</i> is divided hypothetically into forty
<i>nummia</i>, but pieces of five <i>nummia</i> are the smallest coins in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123"> 123</span>
actual use,<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> approximately quarter-farthings, and less even
than continental centimes, etc. The money of old Byzantium
was generally figured with a crescent and a star, or with a
dolphin contorted round a trident,<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> but the Imperial coinage
of Constantinople is stamped on the obverse with the bust of
the reigning emperor,<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> and on the reverse, in the case of gold
or silver pieces, with a figure of Victory bearing a cross and a
crown or some similar device. On the reverse of copper coins,
with accompanying crosses and even crescents, we find a
large letter—M, K, I, or E—indicating that they contain 40, 20,
10, or 5 <i>nummia</i> respectively. As specimens of art the coinage
of this epoch appears degraded to the most uncritical eye.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>The population of Constantinople in the sixth century is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124"> 124</span>
unknown, but it may be estimated with some approach to
accuracy at considerably over a million of inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> The
suburbs also are extremely populous, and for many miles
around the capital, both in Europe and Asia, are covered
with opulent country villas, farmhouses, and innumerable
habitations of meaner residents.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> In this district are situated
immense reservoirs for water, and many of the valleys are
spanned by imposing aqueducts raised by a double series of
lofty arches to a great height.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> At a distance of thirty-two
miles westwards from the city is situated the Long Wall, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125"> 125</span>
stupendous bulwark against the inroads of barbarians, built
by Anastasius in 512. It stretches between the Euxine and
Propontis, a range of nearly fifty miles, and forms also a safe
and facile road for those travelling from sea to sea.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>The description of manners given in this chapter, although
nominally applied only to Constantinople, may be received
as illustrating at this date the social features of the whole
Roman Empire; or, to speak more accurately, of the
Grecian fragment of that empire which once extended universally
over Latins and Greeks.</p>

<p>Before concluding this sociological exposition of the
Graeco-Roman people during the period I am treating of, a
brief reference to their language may be deemed essential to
the integrity of the subject. Viewed from the philological
side the aspect of the Byzantines is peculiar and, perhaps,
unique,<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> since to them may fairly be applied the epithet of a
trilingual nation. By the union of the Roman and Greek
factors of the Empire the Latin tongue, as the official means
of expression, became engrafted on the Eastern provinces;<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>
and in the lapse of centuries a third mode of speech, a
popular vernacular,<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> has been evolved, which often has little
affinity with the first two. Sustained by the solid foundations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126"> 126</span>
of laws and literature, Latin and Greek of a more or less
classical cast<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> are the requisite equipment of every one who
aims at civil or military employment in any governmental
department,<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> or who even pretends to recognition as a
person of average culture. In the pride of original supremacy
we may perceive that citizens of Latin lineage despise the
feeble Greeks who forfeited nationality and independence,
whilst the latter, pluming themselves on their inheritance of
the harmonious tongue in which are enshrined all the
masterpieces of poetry and philosophy, contemn the uninspired
genius of the Romans, whose efforts to create a literature
never soared above imitation and plagiarism.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<small>THE ROMAN EMPIRE UNDER ANASTASIUS: THE INHERITANCE
OF JUSTINIAN</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">That</span> a spirit of dominion was implanted in the breasts
of those early settlers or refugees who rallied around
Romulus, when, about 750 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, he raised his standard on
the Palatine hill, is made plain by the subsequent history of
that infant community; and the native daring which first
won wives for a colony of outcasts, foreshadowed the career
of conquest and empire which eventually attached itself to
the Roman name.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> Contemned, doubtless, and disregarded
by their more reputable neighbours as a band of adventurers
with nothing to lose, in despair of being respected they
determined to make themselves feared; and the original
leaven was infused through every further accretion of population,
and was entailed as an inheritance on all succeeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128"> 128</span>
generations who peopled the expanding city of the Tiber.
When their kings threatened to become despotic they drove
them out; when the patricians attempted to maintain an
exclusive control the more numerous plebs revolted and
gradually achieved the establishment of a republic, in which
political honours and aristocracy became synonymous with
the ability to fill, or the energy to gain, a ruling position.
They devoted themselves with enthusiasm to the task of
self-government, and sacrificed their private interests to the
welfare of the Republic. Without history and without science,
inflated by ambition within their narrow sphere, they applied
the conception of immortality, which millenniums would
not justify, to being acclaimed in the ephemeral fervour of
the populace or to being remembered for a few decades in
the finite language of poetry and rhetoric.</p>

<p>While the Roman state was in its cradle a citizen and a
soldier were equivalent terms, and every man gave his military
service as a free contribution to the general welfare of
the public. But as wars became frequent and aggressive,
and armies were compelled to keep the field for indefinite
periods, a system of payment<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> was introduced in order to
compensate the soldier for the enforced neglect of his family
duties. By the continued growth of the military system, war
became a profession, veteran legions sprang into existence,
and generals, whose rank was virtually permanent, became
a power among the troops and a menace to the state. Finally
the transition was made from a republic governed by a
democracy to an empire ruled by the army. In the meantime
the dominion of Rome had been extended on all sides
to the great natural barriers of its position on the hemisphere;
to the Atlantic ocean on the west, to the Rhine, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129"> 129</span>
Danube, and the Euxine on the north, to the Euphrates on
the east, and on the south to the securest frontier of all, the
impassable deserts of Libya and Arabia.</p>

<p>The first emperors affected to rule as civil magistrates and
accepted their appointment from the Senate, but their successors
assumed the purple as the nominees of the troops,
and often held it by right of conquest over less able competitors.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
Concurrently the Imperial city had been insensibly
undergoing a transformation; by the persistent influx of
strangers of diverse nationalities its ethnical homogeneity
was lost;<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> a new and more populous Rome, in which the
traditions of republican freedom were dissipated, was evolved;
and the inhabitants without a murmur saw themselves deprived
of the right to elect their own magistrates.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> The laws
of the Republic were submitted for ratification to the citizens,
but in the ascent to absolutism the emperor became the sole
legislator of the nation.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> The elevation of an emperor seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130"> 130</span>
at first to be an inalienable privilege of the metropolis, and
the original line of Caesars necessarily descended from a
genuine Roman stock; but in little more than a century the
instability of this law was made plain, and many an able
general of provincial blood was raised to the purple at his
place of casual sojourn.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> In the sequel, when men of an
alien race, who neither knew nor revered Rome, obtained the
first rank, they chose their place of residence according to
some native preference or in view of its utility as a base for
military operations. The simultaneous assumption of the
purple by several candidates in different localities, each at
the head of an army, foreboded the division of the Empire;
and after the second century an avowed sharing of the
provinces became the rule rather than the exception. As each
partner resided within his own territory, Rome gradually
became neglected and at last preserved only a semblance of
being the capital of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> But after Constantine
founded a capital of his own choice even this semblance was
lost, and the new Rome on the Bosphorus assumed the
highest political rank. From this event we may mark the
beginning of mediaevalism, of the passing of western Europe
under the cloud of the dark ages; and the disintegration of
the Roman Empire in the West was achieved by the barbarians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131"> 131</span>
within the following century and a half. In 395 a
final partition of the Empire, naturally halved as it was by
the Adriatic sea, was made; and the incapable sons of Theodosius,
Arcadius and Honorius,<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> were seated as independent
sovereigns on thrones in the East and West. During this
period a central administrative energy to uphold Rome as
an Imperial seat was entirely wanting; and a succession of
feeble emperors maintained a mere shadow of authority
while their provinces were being appropriated by the surplus
populations of the north. Italy and south-west Gaul became
the prey of East and West Goths; the valorous Franks under
Clovis founded a kingdom which made itself permanently
respected under the name of France; Vandals, with kindred
tribes, gained possession of Spain and even erected a monarchy
in north Africa, which extended beyond the limits of
ancient Carthage; Britain, divested of Roman soldiers in
409, for centuries became the goal of acquisitive incursions
by the maritime hordes who issued from the adjacent seaboards,
Saxons, Angles, and Danes.</p>

<p>In the change from a nominally popular or constitutional
monarchy to a professed despotism, a reconstitution of all
subordinate authority was regarded as a matter of necessity.
At first the Empire was administered in about forty provinces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132"> 132</span>
but under the later scheme of control it was parcelled out
into nearly three times that number. In earlier times a Roman
proconsul in his spacious province was almost an independent
potentate during his term of office,<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> the head alike of the
civil and military power. But in the new dispensation no man
was intrusted with such plenary authority, and each contracted
province was ruled by a purely civil administrator, whilst the
local army obeyed a different master. For further security,
each of these in turn was dependent on a higher civil or
military officer, to whom was delegated the collective control
of a number of his subordinates. Again a shift of authority was
made, and the reins of government were delivered into fewer
hands, until, at the head of the system, the source of all
power, stood the Emperor himself. In order to perfect this
policy the army itself was treated in detail on a similar plan;
and for the future no homogeneous body of troops of considerable
number was collocated in the hands of a single leader.
A typical Roman legion had previously consisted of about
six thousand foot, seven hundred horse, and of a band of
auxiliaries drawn from foreign or barbarian sources, in all,
perhaps, ten thousand men. Each legion was thus in itself an
effective force; and as it yielded implicit obedience to a single
praefect, the loyalty or venality of a few such officers in respect
of their common general had often sufficed to seat him
firmly on the throne. To obviate the risk, therefore, of revolt,
usurpation, or even of covert resistance to the will of the
Emperor, existing legions were broken up into detachments
which were relegated to different stations so as to be dispersed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133"> 133</span>
over a wide area. As a consequence the praefect of the legion
could only exist in name, and that office was soon regarded
as obsolete. Consistently, when new legions had to be enrolled
for the exigences of defence or warfare, their number
was limited to about one fifth of the original amount.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> To complete
the fabric of autocracy all the pomp and pretensions of
Oriental exclusiveness were adopted by Diocletian, so that
henceforward the monarch was only accessible to the subject
under forms of such complexity and abasement as seemed to
betoken a being of more than mortal mould.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>Another signal divergence from the simple manners of the
first emperors was the permanent establishment of eunuchs
in high offices about the royal person.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> The Grand Chamberlain,
as the constant attendant on the privacy of the monarch,
generally became his confidant, and sometimes his master.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134"> 134</span>
Ultimately, by habitude, or perhaps with a feeling for the
vicious propensities of the times, the Emperor developed an
almost feminine reserve in relation to the “bearded” or
masculine sex; and in his movements he was guarded by his
staff of eunuchs with as much jealousy as if his virtue were
something as delicate as that of a woman.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>Having dismissed these general considerations, I will now
attempt to depict briefly the state of the remaining moiety
of the Empire, of the Eastern provinces, at the beginning of
the sixth century. In order to render my descriptions more
compact and intelligible, I shall treat the subject under three
distinct headings, viz., Political, Educational, and Religious.</p>


<h3 id="section_I_1">I. <span class="smcap">Political</span></h3>

<p>The dominions of Anastasius the elder,<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> for there was a later
emperor of that name, corresponded generally to those ruled
during the first quarter of the past century by the Ottoman
sultans, who were the last to conquer them, and who became
possessed of the whole in 1461.<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Proceeding from east to west,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135"> 135</span>
the northern boundary of the Empire followed the coast of the
Euxine in its sweep from the mouth of the Phasis (adjacent
to the modern town of Batoum) to the estuaries of the Danube,
as it delimits Asia on the north and Europe on the east,
by the bold curve of its unequal arms. From the latter point,
taking the Danube for its guide, the northern frontier stretched
westwards to its termination on the banks of that river in the
neighbourhood of Sirmium.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> The western border, descending
from thence almost due south, was directed in part of its
course by the river Drina, and halved nearly vertically the
modern principality of Montenegro as it struck towards the
shores of the Adriatic. The coast of Greece, with its associated
islands on this aspect, traced the western outline of the
Empire for the rest of its course, excepting a small portion
to be reached by crossing the Mediterranean to the Syrtis
Major, where at this date the confines of Roman Africa
were to be found. In this vicinity the Egyptian territory
began, and the southern frontier coincided for the most
part with the edge of the Libyan desert as it skirts the
fertile lands of the north and east, that is, the Cyrenaica
and the valley of the Nile. An artificial line, cutting that
valley on a level with the first cataract and the Isle of
Philae, marked the southern extension of Egypt as far as
claimed by the Byzantine emperors.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> From a corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136"> 136</span>
point on the opposite shore of the Red Sea the Asiatic
border of their dominions began. Passing northwards to
regain that part of the Euxine from whence we started, the
eastern frontier pursued a long and irregular track, at first
along the margin of the Arabian desert as it verges on the
Sinaitic peninsula, Palestine, and Syria; then crossing the
Euphrates it gained the Tigris, so as to include the northern
portion of Mesopotamia. Finally, returning to the former
river, it joined it in its course along the western limits of
Armenia,<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> whence it reached the Phasis on the return journey,
the point from which we set out.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Considered in their greatest
length, from the Danube above Sirmium, to Syene on the
Nile, and in their extreme width, from the Tigris in the longitude
of Daras or Nisibis, to the Acroceraunian rocks on the
coast of Epirus, these ample dominions stretch from north to
south for nearly eighteen hundred miles, and from east to
west for more than twelve hundred. In superficial area this
tract may be estimated to contain about half a million of
square miles, that is, an amount of surface fully four times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137"> 137</span>
greater than that covered by Great Britain and Ireland.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> At
the present day it is calculated that these vast regions are
peopled by only about twenty-eight millions of inhabitants,<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
but their modern state of decay is practically the reverse of
their condition in the sixth century, when they were the
flourishing, though already failing, seat of the highest civilization
at that time existing on the earth; and there is good
reason to believe that they were then considerably more,
perhaps even double as, populous.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>For the purposes of civil government the Empire was
divided into sixty-four provinces, each of which was placed
under an administrator, who was usually drawn from the
profession of the law.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> These officers were, as a rule, of
nearly equal rank, but in three instances the exceptional
extent and importance of the provinces necessitated the
bestowal of a title more lofty than usual on the governors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138"> 138</span></p>

<p>1. The whole of Greece, including Hellas proper and the
Peloponnesus, though now no longer classical, was ruled
under the name of Achaia by a vicegerent, to whom was
conceded the almost obsolete dignity of a proconsul. 2.
Similarly, the central maritime division of Asia Minor,
containing the important cities of Smyrna and Ephesus
with many others and grandiosely named “Asia,”<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> was also
allowed to confer on its ruler the title of proconsul. This
magistrate had the privilege of reporting directly to the
Emperor without an intermediary, and had also jurisdiction
over the governors of two adjacent provinces, viz.: the
Hellespont, which abutted on the strait of that name, and
The Islands, a term applied collectively to about a score of
the Cyclades and Sporades. 3. The main district of Lower
Egypt, adorned by the magnificent and populous city of
Alexandria, the second capital of the Empire, was placed
under an administrator bearing the unique title of the
Augustal Praefect. The sixty-one remaining provinces were
intrusted to governors of practically the same standing; of
these, twenty-seven were called consulars, thirty-one presidents,
two correctors, and one duke, the latter officer being on the
southern frontier of Egypt, apparently in both civil and
military charge.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>To enumerate severally in this place all the petty provinces
of the Empire would be mere prolixity, but there are a few
whose designations present peculiarities which may save them
from being passed over without notice. The comprehensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139"> 139</span>
names of Europe and Scythia, which in general suggest such
vast expansions of country, were given to two small portions
of Thrace, the first to that which extended up to the walls
of Constantinople, and the second to the north-east corner
which lay between the Danube and the Euxine.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> With
parallel magniloquence, a limited area adjoining the south-east
border of Palestine was denominated Arabia. The
maritime province of Honorias on the north of Asia Minor,
perpetuated the memory of the despicable Emperor of the
West, Honorius. The name of Arcadia awakens us to reminiscences
of Mount Cyllene with Hermes and “universal”
Pan,<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> of Artemis with her train of nymphs heading the chase
through the woods of Erymanthus, or of the historic career
of Epaminondas and the foundation of Megalopolis. But the
Arcadia officially recognized in the Eastern Empire had no
higher associations than the feeble son of Theodosius,
brother of the above-named, and we may be surprised to find
it in central Egypt with Oxyrhyncus and Memphis for its
chief towns.</p>

<p>By a second disposition of the Empire of an inclusive
kind the provinces were grouped in seven Dioceses, namely:
three European, Dacia,<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> Thrace, and Macedonia; three
Asiatic, the Asian, the Pontic, and the Orient; and one
African, Egypt. The first of these obeys the Praetorian
Praefect of Illyricum, the sixth the Count of the Orient or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140"> 140</span>
East, and the last the Augustal Praefect, whilst the rulers
of the remaining four are entitled Vicars.<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> When I add that
the Orient, the most extensive of these divisions, comprised
in fifteen provinces the whole of Palestine and Syria as well
as the southern tract of Asia Minor, from the Tigris to the
Mediterranean, and the island of Cyprus, the limits of the
other dioceses may be conjectured from their names with
sufficient accuracy for our present purpose.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> By a final
partition the dominions of the Byzantine Emperor were
assigned, but very unequally, to two officers of the highest
or Illustrious rank, viz.: the Praetorian Praefects of the East
and of Illyricum. Dacia and Macedonia fell to the rule of
the latter, whilst the remaining five dioceses were consolidated
under the control of the former minister.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> The
Praefect of the East is in general to be regarded as the
subject in closest proximity to the throne, in fact, the first
minister of the crown.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> The Imperial capital, as being outside
all these subordinate arrangements, was treated as a
microcosm in itself; and with its Court in permanent residence,
its bureaus of central administration, and its special
Praefect of Illustrious rank, may almost be considered as
a third of the prime divisions of the Empire. Here, as a
rule, through the long series of Byzantine annals, by the
voice of the populace and the army, or by the intrigues of
the Court, emperors were made or unmade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141"> 141</span></p>

<p>The whole Empire was traversed by those narrow, but
solidly constructed roads, the abundant remains of which still
attest how thoroughly his work was done by the Roman
engineer.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> The repair and maintenance of these public ways
was enjoined on the possessors of the lands through which
they passed; and similarly in the case of waterways, the care
of bridges and banks was an onus on the shoulders of the
riparian owners.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> On all the main roads an elaborate system
of public posts was studiously maintained; and at certain
intervals, about the length of an average day’s journey,
<i>mansions</i> or inns were located for the accommodation of
those travelling on the public service.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Each of such stations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142"> 142</span>
was equipped with a sufficient number of light and heavy
vehicles, of draught horses and oxen, of pack-horses, sumpter
mules, and asses for the exigences of local transit.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Stringent
rules were laid down for the equitable loading of both animals
and carriages, and also for the humane treatment of the
former. Thus a span of four oxen was allowed to draw a load
of fifteen hundred pounds, but the burden of an ordinary
pack-horse was limited to thirty.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> It was forbidden to beat
the animals with heavy or knotted sticks; they were to be
urged onwards by the use only of a sharp whip or rod fit to
“admonish their lagging limbs with a harmless sting.”<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> In
addition to the mansions there were usually four or five
intermediate stations called <i>mutations</i>, where a few relays
were kept for the benefit of those speeding on an urgent
mission.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> The abuse of the public posts was jealously guarded
against, and only those bearing an order from the Emperor
or one of the Praetorian Praefects could command their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143"> 143</span>
facilities, and then only to an extent restricted to their purely
official requirements. A Vicar could dispose of a train of ten
horses and thirteen asses on a dozen occasions in the year,
in order to make tours of inspection throughout his diocese;
legates from foreign countries and delegates from provincial
centres, journeying to Constantinople to negotiate a treaty or
to lay their grievances before the Emperor, were provided for
according to circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> The highways were constantly
permeated by the Imperial couriers bearing dispatches to or
from the capital.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> These emissaries were also deputed to act
as spies, and to report at head-quarters any suspicious
occurrences they might observe on their route,<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> whence they
were popularly spoken of as “the eyes of the Emperor.”<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>
They were known by their military cloak and belt, their tight
trousers,<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> and by a spray of feathers<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> in their hair to symbolize
the swiftness of their course. One or two were appointed
permanently to each province with the task of scouring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144"> 144</span>
district continually as inspectors of the public posts.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> There
was also a regular police patrol on the roads, called Irenarchs,
whose duty it was to act as guardians of the peace.<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>A Roman emperor of this age, as an admitted despot subjected
to no constitutional restraints, could formulate and
promulgate whatever measures commended themselves to
his arbitrary will. But such authority, however absolute in
theory, must always be restricted in practice by the operation
of sociological laws. Although a prince with a masterful
personality might dominate his subordinates to become the
father or the scourge of his country, a feeble monarch would
always be the slave of his great officers of state. Yet even
the former had to stoop to conciliate the people or the army,
and a sovereign usually stood on treacherous ground when
attempting to maintain a balance between the two.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> The
army, as the immediate and effectual instrument of repression,
was generally chosen as the first stay of the autocracy,
and there are few instances of a Byzantine emperor whose
throne was not on more than one occasion cemented with
the blood of his subjects. But many a virtuous prince in
his efforts to curb the licence of the troops lost both his
sceptre and his life.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Council of the Emperor, besides the three Praefects
already mentioned, consisted of five civil and of an equal
number of military members, all of Illustrious dignity.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> Their
designations were severally: 1. Praepositus of the Sacred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145"> 145</span>
Cubicle, or Grand Chamberlain, Master of the Offices,
Quaestor, Count of the Sacred Largesses, and Count of
the Privy Purse. 2. Five Masters of Horse and Foot,<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> two
at head-quarters,<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> and one each for the Orient, Thrace, and
Illyricum. To these may be added the Archbishop or
Patriarch of Constantinople, always a great power in the
State. In the presence of a variable number of these ministers
it was usual for the Emperor to declare his will, to appeal
to their judgment, or to act on their representations, but
the time, place, and circumstances of meeting were entirely
in the discretion of the prince.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> The formal sittings of
the Council were not held in secret, but before an audience
of such of the Spectabiles as might wish to attend.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> The
legislation of the Emperor, comprised under the general
name of Constitutions, fell naturally into two classes, viz.,
laws promulgated on his own initiative and those issued in
response to some petition. Edicts, Acts, Mandates, Pragmatic
Sanctions, and Epistles usually ranked in the first
division; Rescripts in the second.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> A Rescript was granted,
as a rule, in compliance with an <i>ex parte</i> application, and
might be disregarded by the authority to whom it was addressed
should it appear to have been obtained by false pretences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146"> 146</span>,
but the Court which set it aside did so at its own
peril.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>The Senate of Constantinople, created in imitation of that
of Rome, was designed by Constantine rather to grace his
new capital than to exercise any of the functions of government.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>
Like the new order of patricians, the position of
Senator was mainly an honorary and not an executive rank.
All the members enjoyed the title of Clarissimus, that of the
third grade of nobility, and assembled under the presidency
of the Praefect of the city.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> As a body the Senate was treated
with great ostensible consideration by the Emperor, and was
never referred to in the public acts without expressions of
the highest esteem, such as “the Venerable,” “the Most
Noble Order,” “amongst whom we reckon ourselves.”<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> This
public parade of their importance, however, endowed them
with a considerable moral power in the popular idea; and
the subscription of the impotent Senate was not seldom
demanded by a prudent monarch to give a wider sanction to
his acts of oppression or cruelty.<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> During an interregnum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147"> 147</span>
their voice was usually heard with attention;<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> and a prince
with a weak or failing title to the throne would naturally
cling to them for support.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> They were sometimes constituted
as a High Court for the trial of criminal cases of national
importance, such as conspiring against the rule or life of the
Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> They could pass resolutions to be submitted for
the approval of the crown;<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> they had a share in the nomination
of some of the higher and lower officials; and they performed
generally the duties of a municipal council.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the Imperial provinces there was also, to
facilitate the work of local government, a subsidiary division
of the Empire into Municipia. Every large town or city, with
a tract of the surrounding country, was formed into a municipal
district and placed under the charge of a local Senate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148"> 148</span>
or Curia. The members of a Curia were called Decurions,<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>
and were selected officially to the number of about one hundred
from the more reputable inhabitants of the vicinity.
They not only held office for life, but transmitted it compulsorily
to their heirs, so that the State obtained a perpetual
lien on the services of their descendants. In each Municipium
the official of highest rank was the “Defender of the City,”<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>
who was elected to his post for five years by the independent
suffrage of the community. His chief duty was to defend
the interests of his native district against the Imperial officers
who, as aliens to the locality, were assumed to have little
knowledge or concern as to its actual welfare. He became
<i>ex officio</i> president of the Curia; and in conjunction with
them acted as a judge of first instance or magistrate in causes
of lesser importance.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>A provincial governor, generally called the Rector or
Ordinary Judge, held open court at his Praetorium and sat
within his chancel every morning to hear all causes brought
before him.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> His chancellors guarded the trellis, which fenced
off the outer court against the onrush of eager suitors;<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
within, the advocates delivered their pleadings, whilst a body
of scribes and actuaries took a record in writing of the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149"> 149</span>
proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> The precincts were crowded with his apparitors,<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>
officers upon whom devolved the duty of executing the judgements
of the court. With the aid of his assessor,<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> a legal expert
well versed in the text of the law, the Rector elaborated
his judgment, a written copy of which he was bound to
deliver to each litigant.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> But if his decision were asked in
cases which seemed too trivial for his personal attention, he
was empowered to hand them over to a class of petty judges
called <i>pedanei judices</i>.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> From the provincial court an appeal
lay to the Vicar of the Diocese, or even to the Emperor himself,<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>
but appellants were severely mulcted if convicted of
merely contentious litigation.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> At certain seasons the Rector
went on circuit throughout his province to judge causes and
to inspect abuses.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>I. The permanent existence of any community in a state
of political cohesion depends on its possession of the means
to defray the expenses of government; and, therefore, the
first duty of every primary ruler or administrative body in
chief is to collect a revenue for the maintenance of a national
treasury. The Roman or Byzantine system of raising money
or its equivalent, by means of imposts laid on the subjects
of the Empire, included every conceivable device of taxing
the individual for the benefit of the state. The public were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150"> 150</span>
called on not only to fill the treasury, but were constrained
to devote their resources in kind, their time, and their
labour to the needs of the government. To obtain every
requisite without purchase for the administration was the
economical policy of the ruling class. Food and clothing,
arms and horses, commuted to a money payment if the
thing were unattainable, were levied systematically for the
use of the civil and military establishment. The degree of
personal liability was determined by the assessment of property,
and those who were possessed of nothing were made
liable for their heads. Social distinctions and commercial
transactions were also taxed under well-defined categories.
A considerable section of the community was, however,
legally freed from the regular imposts. This indulgence was
granted especially to the inhabitants of cities, whose facilities
for combination and sedition were always contemplated with
apprehension by the jealous despot. But immunity from
taxation was also extended with some liberality to all who
devoted themselves to art or learning.</p>

<p>1. The financial year began with the first of September,
and was spoken of numerically as an <i>indiction</i>, according to
its place in a perpetually recurring series of fifteen. Properly
an indiction was the period of fifteen years<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> which separated
each new survey and revaluation of the private estates throughout
the Empire. At the beginning of such a term the Imperial
Censitors or surveyors pervaded the country districts,
registering in their books and on their plans all the details<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151"> 151</span>
of the new census.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Their record showed the amount of the
possessions of each landowner; the quality of the land; to
what extent it was cultivated or lay waste; in what proportions
it was laid out in vineyards and olive-grounds; in woods,
pastures, and arable land. The number and magnitude of
the farm and residential buildings were carefully noted, and
even the geniality of the climate, and the apparent fecundity
of the fruit-bearing trees, which were separately counted and
disposed in classes, exercised the judgement of the Censitor
in furnishing materials for a just estimate as to the value of
an estate. Essential also to the <i>cataster</i>, or assessment, was
a list of the flocks and herds possessed by the owner.<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> The
particulars supplied by the Censitor passed into the hands
of another official named a <i>Peraequator</i>. He divided the
district into “heads” of property, each computed to be of
the value of 1,000 solidi,<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> and assigned to each landowner
his census, that is, the number of heads for which in future
he would be taxed. This assessment was not based on a
mere valuation of the property of each person; it was complicated
by the principle of Byzantine finance that all land
should pay to the Imperial exchequer. It was the duty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152"> 152</span>
therefore, of a Peraequator, to assign a nominal possession
in barren or deserted land to each owner in fair proportion
to his apparent means. Thus the possessor of a valuable
farm was often encumbered with a large increment of worthless
ground, whilst the owner of a poor one might escape
such a burthen.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> Yet a third official, called an <i>Inspector</i>,<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
came upon the scene, but his services were not always constant
or comprehensive. He visited the province in response
to petitions or appeals from dissatisfied owners, or was sent
to solve matters of perplexity.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> His acquirements were the
same as those of a Peraequator, but, whereas the latter was
obliged to impose a rate on some one for every hide of land,
the Inspector was allowed considerable discretion. After a
strict scrutiny he was empowered to give relief in clear cases
of over-assessment, and even to exclude altogether any tracts
of land which could not fairly be imposed on any of the inhabitants
of the district. Before final ratification, the cataster
had to pass under the eyes of the local Curia, the provincial
Rector, and of the Imperial financiers at the capital. The
<i>polyptica</i> or censual books were then closed, and remained
immutable until the next indiction.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p>2. Appended to the land survey was a register of the
labourers, slaves, and animals employed by the possessors of
estates; and upon every ordinary adult of this caste a poll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153"> 153</span>-tax
was imposed.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> Similarly with respect to every animal
which performed a task, horses, oxen, mules, and asses for
draught purposes, and even dogs.<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> For this demand the
landowner alone was dealt with by the authorities, but he
was entitled to recover from his labourers whatever he paid
on account of themselves or their families. As this capitation
was very moderate, the individual was freed from it by the
possession of the smallest holding, and subjected to the land-tax
instead;<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> but the farmer still paid vicariously for his
work-people, even when assessed on property of their own.
Slaves were always, of course, a mere personal asset of their
masters, and incapable of ownership. A sweeping immunity
from poll-tax was conferred on all urban communities,<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> whence
nobles and plutocrats escaped the impost for the hosts of
servants they sometimes maintained at their city mansions;
but even in the rural districts, virgins,<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> widows, certain professional
men, and skilled artizans generally, were exempt.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154"> 154</span></p>

<p>3. Port or transit dues, called <i>vectigalia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> were levied on
all merchandise transported from one province to another
for the sake of gain, that is, for resale at a profit; but for
purely personal use residents were permitted to pass a limited
quantity of goods free of tax. In this category may be included
licenses for gold-mining, which cost the venturer
about a guinea a year.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Taxes of this class were let out by
public auction for a term of three years to those who bid
highest for the concession of collecting them.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Export of
gold from the Empire was forbidden, and those who had the
opportunity, were exhorted to use every subterfuge in order
to obtain it from the barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>4. A tax, peculiar in some respects to the Byzantine Empire,
was the <i>lustral collation</i> or <i>chrysargyron</i>, a duty of the
most comprehensive character on the profits of all commercial
transactions.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Trade in every shape and form was subjected
to it, not excepting the earnings of public prostitutes, beggars,
and probably even of catamites.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> The <i>chrysargyron</i> was
collected every fourth year only, and for this reason, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155"> 155</span>
appears, was felt to be a most oppressive tax.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Doubtless
the demand was large in proportion to the lapse of time since
the last exaction, and weighed upon those taxed, like a sudden
claim for accumulated arrears. When the time for payment
arrived, a wail went up from all the small traders whose
traffic barely sufficed to keep them in the necessaries of life.
To procure the money, parents frequently, it is said, had to
sell their sons into servitude and their daughters for prostitution.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>
There were limited exemptions in favour of ministers
of the orthodox faith and retired veterans, who might engage
in petty trade; of artists selling their own works; and of
farmers who sold only their own produce.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> The most popular
and, perhaps, the boldest measure of Anastasius, was the
abrogation of this tax.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Fortifying himself with the acquiescence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156"> 156</span>
of the Senate, he proclaimed its abolition, caused all
the books and papers relating to this branch of the revenue
to be heaped up in the sphendone of the Hippodrome, and
publicly committed them to the flames.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> The chrysargyron
was never afterwards reimposed.</p>

<p>5. With some special taxes reaped from dignitaries of
state, the income derived from crown lands and state mines,
and with fines, forfeitures, and heirless patrimonies, the flow of
revenue into the Imperial coffers ceased. From a fiscal point
of view there were four classes of Senators, or to consider
more accurately, perhaps, only two: those who were held to
contribute something to the treasury in respect of their rank,
and those who were absolved from paying anything. Wealthy
Senators, possessed of great estates, paid an extraordinary
capitation proportioned to the amount of their property, but
lands merely adjected to fill up the census were exempt
under this heading; those of only moderate means were
uniformly indicted for two <i>folles</i>, or purses of silver, about
£12 of our money; whilst the poorest class of all were
obliged to a payment of seven <i>solidi</i> only, about £4, with a
recommendation to resign if they felt unequal to this small
demand.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> Members who enjoyed complete immunity were
such as received the title of Senator in recognition of long,
but comparatively humble, service to the state; amongst these
we find certain officers of the Guards, physicians, professors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157"> 157</span>
of the liberal arts, and others.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Not even, however, with
their set contributions were the Senators released from the
pecuniary onus of their dignity, for they were expected to
subscribe handsome sums collectively to be presented to the
sovereign on every signal occasion, such as New Year’s day,
lustral anniversaries of his reign, birth of an heir, etc.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> When
any of the great functionaries of state, during or on vacating
office, were ennobled with the supreme title of patrician, an
offering of 100 lb. of gold (£4,000) was considered to be the
smallest sum by which he could fittingly express his gratitude
to the Emperor; this accession of revenue was particularly
devoted to the expenses of the aqueducts.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> An oblation of
two or three horses was also exacted every five years for the
public service from those who acquired honorary codicils of
ex-president or ex-count.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> Finally a tax, also under the
semblance of a present, was laid on the Decurions of each
municipality, who, in acknowledgement of their public services,
were freed from all the lesser imposts. To this contribution
was applied the name of <i>coronary gold</i>, the conception
of which arose in earlier times when gold, in the form
of crowns or figures of Victory, was presented to the Senate,
or to the generals of the Republic who had succeeded in
subjecting them, by conquered nations in token of their
subservience.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> These presentations were enjoined on every
plausible occasion of public rejoicing and the Imperial
officials did not forget to remind the local Curiae of their
duty to overlook no opportunity of conveying their congratulations
in a substantial manner to the Emperor. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158"> 158</span>
Imperial demesnes lay chiefly in Cappadocia, which contained
some breadths of pasture land unequalled in any
other part of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> The province was from the
earliest times famous for its horses, which were considered
as equal, though not quite, to the highly-prized Spanish
breeds in the West.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Mines for gold, silver, and other valuable
minerals, including marble quarries, were regularly
worked by the Byzantine government in several localities
both in Europe and Asia; but history has furnished us with
no precise indications as to the gains drawn from them.<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
Under the penal code, to send criminals to work in the
mines was classed as one of the severest forms of punishment.<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>The <i>exaction</i> of the <i>annones</i> and <i>tributes</i>, expressions
which virtually included all the imposts, was the incessant
business of the official class. At the beginning of each
financial year the measure of the precept to be paid by each
district was determined in the office of the Praetorian Praefect,
subscribed by the Emperor, and disseminated through
the provinces by means of notices affixed in the most public
places.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> A grace of four months was conceded and then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159"> 159</span>
gathering in of the <i>annones</i> or canon of provisions, which
included corn, wine, oil, flesh, and every other necessary for
the support of the army and the free distributions to the
urban populace, began. Delivery was enjoined in three instalments
at intervals of four months,<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> but payments in gold
were not enforced until the end of the year.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> The <i>Exactors</i>,
who waited on the tributaries to urge them to performance,
were usually decurions or apparitors of the Rector.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> The Imperial
constitutions directed with studied benignity that no
ungracious demeanour should be adopted towards the tax-payers,<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
that no application should be made on Sundays,<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
that they should not be approached by <i>opinators</i>, that is, by
soldiers in charge of the military commissariat,<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> that they
should, when possible, be allowed the privilege of <i>autopragias</i>
or voluntary delivery,<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> and that, if recalcitrant, they should
not be sent to prison or tortured, but allowed their liberty
under formal arrest.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> Only in the last resource was anything
of their substance seized as a pledge, to be sold “under the
spear” if unredeemed,<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> but in general any valid excuse was
accepted and the tributaries were allowed to run into arrears.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
Consonantly, however, to the prevailing principle every
effort was made by the Exactors to amass the full precept
from the locality, and those who could pay were convened
to make up for the defaulters.<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> The actual receivers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160"> 160</span>
canon were named <i>Susceptors</i>, and their usual place of custom
was at the mansions or mutations of the public posts.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
Scales and measures were regularly kept at these stations,<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>
and on stated occasions a Susceptor was in attendance accompanied
by a <i>tabularius</i>, a clerk who was in charge of the
censual register which showed the liability of each person in
the municipality.<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> The <i>tabularius</i> gave a receipt couched in
precise terms to each tributary for the amount of his payment
or consignment, particulars of which he also entered
in a book kept permanently for the purpose.<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> The system
of <i>adaeratio</i>, or commutation of species for money, was extensively
adopted to obviate difficulties of delivery in kind;
and this was especially the case with respect to clothing or
horses for the army, or when transit was arduous by reason
of distance or rough country.<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> The transport of the annones
and tributes to their destination was a work of some magnitude,
and was under the special supervision of the Vicar of
the diocese.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> Inland the <i>bastagarii</i>, the appointed branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161"> 161</span>
of the public service, effected the transmission by means of
the beasts of burden kept at the mansions of the Posts;<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> by
sea the <i>navicularii</i> performed the same task. The latter
formed a corporation of considerable importance to which
they were addicted as the decurions were to the Curia.
Selected from the seafaring population who possessed ships
of sufficient tonnage, their vessels were chartered for the
conveyance of the canon of provisions as a permanent and
compulsory duty.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> Money payments, in coin or ingots, went
to the capital;<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> provisions to the public granaries of Constantinople<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162"> 162</span>
or Alexandria, the two cities endowed with a free
victualling market,<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> or were widely dispersed to various
centres to supply rations for the troops.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> Besides the ordinary
officials engaged in exaction there were several of higher
rank to supervise their proceedings: <i>Discussors</i>, the Greek
<i>logothetes</i>, who made expeditions into the provinces from
time to time to scrutinize and audit the accounts;<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> surveyors
of taxes, Senators preferably, whose duties were defined
by the term <i>protostasia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> to whom the <i>Susceptors</i> were
immediately responsible; and lastly <i>Compulsors</i>, officers of
the central bureaucracy, <i>Agentes-in-rebus</i>, palatines attached
to the treasury, even Protectors, who were sent on special
missions to stimulate the Rectors when the taxes of a province
were coming in badly.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<p>As to the revenue of the Roman Empire at this or at
any previous period, the historian can pronounce no definitive
word, but it concerns us to note here one important
fact, viz., that Anastasius during the twenty-seven years of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163"> 163</span>
his reign saved about half a million sterling per annum, so
that at his death he left a surplus in the treasury of nearly
£13,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>II. The political position of the Roman Empire in respect
of its foreign relations presents a remarkable contrast to
anything we are accustomed to conceive of in the case of a
modern state. Having absorbed into its own system everything
of civilization which lay within reach of its arms, there
was henceforth no field in which statesmanship could exert
itself by methods of negotiation or diplomacy in relation to
the dwellers beyond its borders. Encompassed by barbarians,
to live by definite treaty on peaceful terms with its neighbours
became outside the range of policy or foresight; and its
position is only comparable to that of some great bulwark
founded to resist the convulsions of nature, which may leave
it unassailed for an indefinite period, or attack it without a
moment’s warning with irresistible violence. The vast territories
stretching from the Rhine and the Danube to the
frontiers of China, nearly a quarter of the circumference of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164"> 164</span>
the globe, engendered a teeming population, nomads for the
most part, without fixed abodes, who threatened continually
to overflow their boundaries and bring destruction on every
settled state lying in their path. Among such races the army
and the nation were equivalent terms; the whole people
moved together, and inhabited for the time being whatever
lands they had gained by right of conquest. But their career
was brought to a close when they subdued nations much
more numerous than themselves, with fixed habitations and
engaged in the arts of peace; and they then possessed the
country as a dominant minority, which, whilst giving a
peculiar tincture to the greater mass, was gradually assimilated
by it. In classical and modern times conquest usually
signifies merely annexation, but in the Middle Ages it
implied actual occupation by the victors. Such was the fate
of the Western Empire, when Italy, Africa, Spain, Gaul, and
Britain were dissevered from each other by various inroads;
and those countries at the time I am writing of are found
to be in such a transitional state.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> Nor can Thrace and
Illyricum, though forming a main portion of the Eastern
Empire, be properly omitted from this list; for, exposed to
barbarian incursions<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> during more than two centuries, they
enjoyed a merely nominal settlement under the Imperial
government; and if we contemplate the Long Wall<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165"> 165</span>
Anastasius, at a distance of only forty miles from the capital,
we shall need no further evidence that the Byzantines exercised
no more than a shadow of political supremacy in
these regions.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> But an exception to the foregoing conditions
was generally experienced by the Romans on their eastern
frontier, where the Parthian or Persian power was often able
to meet them with a civil and military organization equal to
their own.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p>The elaborate scheme for the defence of the Empire
against its restless and reckless foes was brought to perfection
under Diocletian and Constantine. Armies and fleets
judiciously posted were always ready to repel an attack or to
carry offensive operations into an enemy’s country. A chain
of muniments guarded the frontiers in every locality where
an assault could be feared. Forts and fortified camps sufficiently
garrisoned lined every barrier, natural or artificial,
at measured distances. Suitable war vessels floated on the
great circumscribing waterways; and where these were deficient
their place was supplied by walls of masonry, by
trenches, embankments, and palisades, or even by heterogeneous
obstructions formed of felled trees with their
branches entangled one with the other.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> Border lands were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166"> 166</span>
granted only to military occupants, who held them by a
kind of feudal tenure in return for their service on the
frontier.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> Every important station was guarded by from
2,000 to 3,000 soldiers; and in the Eastern Empire the
division of the army to which such duties were assigned may
have amounted to over 200,000 men of all soldiers, arms,<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> etc. These
forces were called the <i>Limitanei Milites</i>, or Border Soldiers,
and in each province of the exterior range were under the
command collectively of a Count or Duke.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> Such were the
stationary forces of the Empire, of whose services the frontiers
could not be depleted should a mobile army be required to
meet the exigences of strategic warfare. Large bodies of
troops were, therefore, quartered in the interior of the
country, which could be concentrated in any particular
locality under the immediate disposition of the Masters of
the Forces. This portion of the army was organized in two
divisions to which were given the names of <i>Palatines</i> and
<i>Comitatenses</i>. The former, which held the first rank, were
stationed in or near the capital under the two Masters<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> at
head-quarters; and, in accordance with their designation,
were identified most nearly with the conception of defending
the Imperial Palace or heart of the state. The latter were
distributed throughout the provinces under the three Masters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167"> 167</span>
whose military rule extended over the East, Thrace, and
Illyricum respectively. The <i>Palatine</i> troops comprised about
50,000 men, the <i>Comitatenses</i> about 70,000.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Cavalry formed
a large proportion of all the forces, and may be estimated at
about one third of the <i>Limitanei</i> and nearly one fourth of
the other branches. In addition to these troops a fourth
military class, the highest of all, was formed, the Imperial
Guards already mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> viz., the Excubitors, Protectors,
Candidates, and Scholars. The latter body consisted of seven
troops of cavalry, each 500 strong, 3,500 in all.<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> Owing their
position solely to birth or veteran service, the three former
groups were probably much less numerous, but their actual
number is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> The usual division of the infantry was
the legion of 1,000 men, that of the horse the <i>vexillatio</i> containing
500.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> The various bodies of foot soldiers were distinguished
by the particular emblems which were depicted
on their brightly painted shields,<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> but amongst horse and
foot alike each separate body was recognizable by an ensign
of special design, for the former a <i>vexillum</i>, for the latter a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168"> 168</span>
dragon. The Imperial standard, or that of the general in
chief command, was a purple banner embroidered with gold
and of exceptional size. The <i>vexilla</i> were dependent horizontally
from a cross-bar fixed to the pole or spear by which
they were elevated. Mounted lancers displayed small pennons
or streamers near the points of their weapons,<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> but
these were removed as an encumbrance on the eve of battle.<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>
Full armour was worn, in some troops even by the horses.<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>
Besides the weapons adapted for close conflict, much reliance
was placed on missiles, javelins and slings, but especially
bows and arrows in the hands of mounted archers.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> In replenishing
the ranks great discrimination was exercised; and
not only the physical fitness of the recruit,<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> but the social
atmosphere in which he had sprung up was made the subject
of strict inquiry. No slave was accepted as a soldier,<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> nor
any youth whose mind had been debased by menial employment
or by traffic for petty gains in the slums of a city.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169"> 169</span>
sons of veterans were impressed into the service,<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> and the
landowners had periodically either to provide from their own
family or to pay a computed sum for the purchase of a substitute
among such as were not liable to conscription.<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> Many of
the turbulent barbarian tribes on being subdued were obliged
by the articles of a treaty to pay an annual tribute of their
choicest youths to the armies of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> In addition to
the regular forces, barbarian contingents, called <i>foederati</i>,<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>
obeying their own leaders, were often bound by a league to
serve under the Imperial government. In Europe the Goths,
in Asia the Saracens, were usually the most important of
such allies. Of the former nation Constantine at one time
attached to himself as many as 40,000, an effort in which
he was afterwards emulated by the great Theodosius.<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> The
warships of the period were mostly long, low galleys impelled
by one bank of oars from twenty to thirty in number,
built entirely with a view to swiftness and hence called
<i>dromons</i> or “runners.” The smaller ones were employed on
the rivers, the larger for operations at sea.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> After a period
of service varying from fifteen to twenty-four years the
soldier could retire as a veteran with a gratuity, a grant of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170"> 170</span>
land, and exemption from taxation on a graduated scale for
himself and his family.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>

<p>Such was the carefully digested scheme of military defence
bequeathed to his successors by Constantine, who doubtless
anticipated that he had granted a lease of endurance to the
regenerated Empire for many centuries to come. But in the
course of a hundred and fifty years this fine system fell
gradually to pieces; and by the beginning of the sixth
century no more than a <i>cento</i> of the original fabric can be
discerned in the chronicles of the times. The whole forces
were diminished almost to a moiety of their full complement;<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>
the great peripheral bulwark of the <i>Limitanei</i>, scarcely
discoverable on the Illyrian frontier, in other regions was
represented by meagre bodies of one or two hundred men;<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>
whilst the <i>Palatines</i> and <i>Comitatenses</i> betrayed such an
altered character that they could claim merely a nominal
existence.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> The very name of legion, so identified with
Roman conquest, but no longer available in the deteriorated
military organization, became obsolete. In a Byzantine
army at this period three constituents exist officially, but
with little practical distinction. They appear as the <i>Numeri</i>,<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
the <i>Foederati</i>, and the <i>Buccellarii</i>. 1. The <i>Numeri</i> are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171"> 171</span>
regular troops of the Empire, horse and foot, enrolled under
the direct command of the Masters of the Forces, but the
principle of strict selection has been virtually abandoned,
applicants are accepted indiscriminately,<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> and even slaves
are enlisted and retained under any plausible pretext.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> 2. The
<i>Foederati</i> now consist of bodies of mercenaries raised as a
private speculation by soldiers of fortune, with the expectation
of obtaining lucrative terms for their services from the
Imperial government.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> Such regiments were formed without
regard to nationality, and might be composed mainly, or in
part, of subjects of the Empire, or be wholly derived from
some tribe of outer barbarians who offered themselves in a
body for hire. On being engaged, each band received an
<i>optio</i> or adjutant, who formed the connecting link between
them and the central authorities, and arranged all matters
relating to their <i>annones</i> and stipend.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> But the tie was so
loose that even on a foreign expedition they might arbitrarily
dissolve the contract for some trivial reason, and possibly
join the enemy’s forces.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> 3. The <i>Buccellarii</i><a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> are the armed
retainers or satellites of the Byzantine magnates, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172"> 172</span>
civil or military, but especially of the latter. Officially they
are reckoned among the <i>Foederati</i>,<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> and are obliged to take
an oath of allegiance, not only to their actual chief, but also
to the Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> Their number varied according to the
rank and wealth of their employers, and in the case of the
Praetorian Praefects, or the Masters of the Forces, might
amount to several thousands.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> In each company they were
divided into two classes, named respectively the lancers and
the shieldmen. The former were selected men who formed
the personal guard of their leader, the latter the rank and
file who were officered by them.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> The lancers were invariably
cavalry, the shieldmen not necessarily so. These satellites
were recruited preferably amongst the Isaurians,<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> a
hardy race of highlanders, who, though within the Empire,
always maintained a quasi-independence in their mountain
fastnesses, and devoted themselves openly to brigandage.<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>
To check their depredations a military Count was always
set over that region, which thus resembled a frontier rather
than an interior province. A fleet of warships was not kept
up systematically at this epoch, but in view of an expedition,
owing to the small size of the vessels, a navy could be created
in a few weeks.<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>From the foregoing specification it will be perceived that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173"> 173</span>
the method of enrollment constituted the only practical difference
between the three classes of soldiers who marched in
the ranks of a Byzantine army. The maintenance of the
Empire rested, therefore, on a heterogeneous multitude,
trained to the profession of arms no doubt, but without the
cohesion of nationality or uniform military discipline.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> In
the multifarious host the word of command was given in
Latin, which Greek and barbarian alike were taught to understand.<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>Every student of ancient history is familiar with the
methods of warfare among the Greeks and Romans; with the
impenetrable, but inactive, phalanx which subdued the eastern
world; and with the less solid, but mobile, legion which
ultimately succeeded in mastering it.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> Such armies consisted
mainly of infantry; and the small bodies of cavalry attached
to them, amounting to one tenth, or, perhaps, to as little as
one twentieth part of the whole, were intended merely to
protect the flanks of each division, or to render more effective
the pursuit of a flying enemy. In those times, therefore, the
horsemen were only an auxiliary force, which never engaged
in battle as an independent army. But in the multiple
operations against elusive barbarians in the wide circuit of
the Roman Empire, experience made it evident that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174"> 174</span>
mobility of cavalry was indispensable in order to deal effectively
with such wary and reckless foes.<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> Early in the fourth century
the number and importance of the cavalry had increased
to such an extent that they were relegated to a separate
command: and the Master of the Horse was regarded as of
superior rank to his colleague of the infantry.<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> In the East,
however, both branches of the service were soon combined
under a single commander-in-chief; and henceforward the
first military officers are entitled Masters of the Horse and
Foot, or, collectively, of the Forces.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>At the period I am writing about, the usual routine of a
pitched battle is to range the infantry in the centre with large
squadrons of cavalry on either flank.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Both armies first exhaust
their supply of missiles, after which a general engagement at
close quarters ensues. By the aid of various evolutions, concealed
reserves, and unexpected manœuvres, the opposing
generals strive to take each other at a disadvantage, and victory
rests with the most skilful or fortunate tactician. Single combats
in the interspace between the two armies are not unfrequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175"> 175</span>
initiatory to a battle;<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> and sometimes a campaign
is decided by conflicts of cavalry alone.<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<p>The various classes of Imperial guards still exist as a fourth
division of the army, but, owing to the introduction of a
system of purchase, these corps have degenerated into the
condition of being mere figures to be mechanically paraded
in the course of state pageantry; soldiers apparently, and
in resplendent uniforms, but unversed in war, who would
sooner buy their release for a large sum than enter on a
campaign.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a></p>

<p>The wars of Anastasius may be reviewed briefly in this
section. They were four in number. 1. At the outset of his
reign he found himself opposed within the capital by a strong
faction of turbulent Isaurians, the relations and adherents of
the late Emperor Zeno. Some of these held high office, and had
even aspired to the throne.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> On their dismissal and banishment
from Constantinople the leaders fled to Isauria, where they
levied large forces, and raised a rebellion by the aid of arms
and treasure which Zeno had seen fit to amass in his native
province.<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> The insurgents kept up hostilities for a long period
with declining success against the Imperial generals, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176"> 176</span>
revolt was not fully suppressed till the seventh year (498).<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>
In the fourth year of the war, however, the ringleaders were
captured and decapitated, and their heads were sent to
Constantinople, where they were exhibited to the populace
fixed on poles in the suburb of Sycae.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> The pacification of
the province was achieved by this war more effectually than
on any previous occasion, and the Isaurians do not again
appear in history as refractory subjects of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

<p>2. In 502 the Persian king, Cavades,<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> applied to Anastasius
for the loan of a large sum of money which he required in
order to cement an alliance with the barbarian nation of the
Nephthalites or White Huns.<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> For politic reasons this loan
was refused, and the exasperated potentate immediately
turned his arms against the Empire. He invaded the western
portion of Armenia, which was under Roman suzerainty,<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> and
took one or two towns of minor importance before an army
could be sent against him. The principal feature of this war,
which lasted about four years, was the capture and recovery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177"> 177</span>
of Amida, a strongly fortified city of considerable size, situated
in northern Mesopotamia, on the banks of the Tigris. Although
ill-garrisoned, and neither armed nor provisioned to
stand a siege, the inhabitants received the Persians with the
most insulting defiance and made a very determined resistance
for some months. The massive walls withstood the
attacking engines, and all the devices of the besiegers were
baffled by the ingenuity of those within the city. In despair
Cavades had already given orders to raise the siege when the
downfall of Amida was brought about by a very singular
circumstance, as related by the chief historian of the period.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
In the excess of popular frenzy at the news of the proposed
retreat, the harlots of the town hastened to the battlements
in order to jeer at the Persian monarch as he passed on his
rounds, by making an indecent exposure of their persons.
This obscene conduct so impressed the Magi in attendance
that they gave it a mystical signification, and imparted their
opinion to the King that “everything hidden and secret in
Amida would shortly be laid bare.” The departure was
countermanded, and ultimately, through the supineness or
treachery of some monks, to whom the guard of one of the
main towers had been confided, an entry was made. A vengeful
massacre of the vanquished then took place,<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> which was
only stayed by the wit of a suppliant priest, who, in answer
to the irate question of Cavades, “How did you dare to resist
me so violently?” replied, “That the city might be won<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178"> 178</span>
by your valour and not by our cowardice.” Two years later,
as a result of a protracted but ineffective siege, the Persians
agreed to evacuate the town for a payment of one thousand
pounds of gold (£40,000). On entering, the Romans discovered
to their chagrin that such a state of destitution prevailed
as would have compelled the surrender of the stronghold
within a few days. The conclusion of this war was
brought about by an invasion of the Huns,<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> who threatened
Persia from the north; and hence Cavades was glad to make
peace for seven years, on terms which left both parties in the
same position as before the commencement of hostilities.
The issue of this conflict was, on the whole, favourable to
Anastasius, who, in the sense of being the superior power,
soon proceeded to infringe the articles of the treaty by erecting
commanding fortresses against his late foes along his
eastern border. Especially as a counterpoise to the impregnable
Nisibis, which had been ceded to the Persians a century
and a half previously by the inept Jovian,<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> he raised the insignificant
village of Daras to the rank of an important town,
and surrounded it with bastions of imposing strength.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> The
impotent protests of the Persians were disregarded, and
the two empires did not again come into martial collision for
more than twenty years.</p>

<p>3. In 505 Anastasius and Theodoric, the Gothic king in
Italy, by mutual inadvertence, as it may be judged, became
involved in a conflict. Simultaneously the Master of the
Forces in Illyricum and the Gothic general Petza were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179"> 179</span>
engaged in suppressing their several enemies in that region.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>
The antagonist of the Byzantine general was Mundo, a bandit
chief of the blood of Attila, who, with a body of Hunnish
marauders, was preying on the country. He, on the point of
being worsted, craved the assistance of Petza, who, seeing in
him a natural ally of kindred race, joined him with his
forces. The Goth had, in fact, just achieved the object of
his expedition and probably made this move in the heat of
success. Together they routed the Imperial army, which was
shattered beyond all chance of reparation.<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> To avenge this
defeat, Anastasius in 508 fitted out a naval expedition, which
conveyed a landing force of 8,000 soldiers to the Italian
coast. Making an unforeseen descent on Tarentum, they
ravaged the vicinity with piratical ferocity, and returned as
hastily as they came.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> Theodoric, however, did not feel equal
to pitting himself against the forces and resources of the East,
and decided not to resent these reprisals. He deprecated the
wrath of the Emperor in deferential language, and these
encounters were soon forgotten as merely fortuitous disturbances
of the peace.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>4. In 514 the studied economy of Anastasius provoked
an upheaval of the incongruous elements of the state, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180"> 180</span>
threatened the immediate collapse of his administration.
From the hordes of barbarians massed on the banks of the
Danube, troops were continually detached to take service
under the Empire as <i>Foederati</i>; and their numbers had
increased to such an extent that the annones due to them
became an intolerable drain on the revenue. A sweeping
reduction of these supplies was, therefore, decreed;<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> a
measure judicious in itself, which would probably have been
supported in sullen silence by the barbarians had not Count
Vitalian, a Goth, and their principal leader, perceived that a
specious means of retaliation was to hand. Taking advantage
of the religious intractability of Anastasius, which was the
bane of his rule and had alienated from him most of his
pious subjects, he announced himself as the champion of
orthodoxy, and proclaimed a holy war against the heretical
Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> The cry was taken up universally, and, especially
within the capital, all the factious fanatics clamoured for
Vitalian as the legitimate occupant of the throne. An
immense host of <i>Foederati</i> followed the standard of the rebel;
a great battle was fought in Thrace, with the result that the
Imperial army was cut to pieces, suffering a loss, it is said,
of more than sixty thousand.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> A fleet was placed at the
disposal of the pretender, whereupon Vitalian moved on the
capital and blockaded Constantinople by land and sea.
Against this attack the Emperor concerted measures within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181"> 181</span>
the city with some Athenian philosophers, their chemical
knowledge was utilized effectively, galleys which ejected
bituminous combustibles were launched against the hostile
ships, and the investing fleet retreated precipitately amid
volumes of fire and smoke.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> The diplomacy of the almost
nonagenarian monarch during this revolt was marked by
much temporizing and duplicity; he disarmed the <i>Foederati</i>
by a liberal donative,<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> and by raising their captain to the
rank of Master of the Forces in Thrace;<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> he mollified the
orthodox ecclesiastics by promises and prepared instruments
for the recall of exiled bishops; and he appealed to Pope
Hormisdas praying that a synod should meet at Heraclea in
order to appease the dissensions of the Church.<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> The synod
met after protracted negotiations, but the combination was
already dissolved, and the head of rebellion was broken;
the concessions offered by the Emperor were presented and
found to be illusory, and the futile assembly separated
without any tangible result.<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> Anastasius had carried his
point; active, yet impotent discontent reigned everywhere,
but he had yielded nothing; and soon afterwards, in extreme
old age, he sank into the grave<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> amid the familiar waves of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182"> 182</span>
sedition which for twenty-seven years had raged ineffectually
round his throne.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>III. The commercial activities of the ancient world, as far
as they come within the vision of history, were almost confined
to these countries which encircle the basin of the
Mediterranean; and in the early centuries of our era the
varied regions to be measured between the Ganges and
Gades were conceived to represent approximately the whole
extent of the habitable earth.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> Although the theory of a
globe was held by advanced geographers and astronomers,
the fact had not been established by circumnavigation and
survey; and the idea was so far from being realized by the
masses, that the notion of antipodes seemed to them to be
little less than preposterous.<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> In the obscurity of prehistoric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183"> 183</span>
times the arts and sciences appear to have originated in the
East; and from thence, by the aid of Greece and Rome,
civilization extended until it included almost all the known
parts of Western Africa and Europe. Before the beginning
of the sixth century, however, owing to the incursions and
settlements of Goths and Vandals, those western countries
had retrograded nearly to the same level of barbarism from
which they had been rescued formerly by the civilizing arms
of Rome.</p>

<p>In the earliest ages the trade of the Mediterranean was
entirely in the hands of the Semitic race; and from their
great ports of Tyre and Sidon the Phoenicians penetrated with
their well-laden ships even as far as Spain and Britain,<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>
disposing of their native manufactures and imported wares
on every coast within their reach.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> But with the rise and
spread of Hellenic civilization, commerce became more
cosmopolitan; and by the conquests of Alexander the
Greeks were made practically cognizant of a Far East teeming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184"> 184</span>
with productions which could minister to the needs of
increasing wealth and luxury. At the same period, about
330 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the foundation of Alexandria by that monarch gave
them the command of Egypt, and they began to explore the
borders of the Arabian Gulf or Red Sea as far as the Gulf
of Aden and the confines of equatorial Africa. Concomitantly
the laborious voyage of Nearchus,<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> undertaken at the
instigation of the Macedonian conqueror, along inhospitable
shores from the mouth of the Indus to the head of the
Persian Gulf, revealed to the Greeks the existence of a chain
of navigable seas by which the treasures of the Indies might
be brought by water to the wharves of the new capital.
Through the establishment of this commerce Alexandria
became the greatest trading centre of the Mediterranean,
and distributed its exports to every civilized community who
peopled the extended littoral of that sea.<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

<p>The first merchants who crossed the Indian ocean, embarking
in small ships of light draught, timidly hugged the
shore during their whole voyage, dipping into every bight
for fear of losing sight of land. But in the reign of Claudius
a navigator named Hippalus discovered the monsoons, and
noted their stability as to force and direction at certain seasons
of the year.<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> Thenceforward the merchants, furnishing
themselves with larger vessels,<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> boldly spread their sails to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185"> 185</span>
the wind, ventured into mid-ocean, and made a swift and
continuous passage from the southern coast of Arabia to some
chosen port in the vicinity of Bombay.<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> Such was the southern,
and, within the Christian era, most frequented trade route
between the Roman Empire and the Indies. There were,
however, two other avenues, more ancient, but less safe and
less constant, by which merchandise from the far East, mainly
by inland transit, could enter the Empire. By the first of
these, which traversed many barbarous nations, the eastern
shores of the Euxine were brought into communication with
northern India through the Oxus, the Caspian Sea, and the
Cyrus. From a bend in the latter river, the emporium of the
trade, the town of Phasis, was easily attainable.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> The second,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186"> 186</span>
intermediately situated, was the most direct and facile of
the three, but, as it lay through the Persian dominions, the
activity of commerce by this route depended on the maintenance
of peace between the two empires.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> The Byzantine
government, jealous of the intercourse of its subjects with their
hereditary enemies, fixed Artaxata, Nisibis, and Callinicus<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>
as marts beyond which it was illegal for Roman merchants
to advance for the purposes of trade on this frontier.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

<p>In the sixth century the Ethiopian kingdom of Axume,<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>
nearly corresponding with Abyssinia, became the southern
centre of international trade; and its great port of Adule was
frequented by ships and traders from all parts of the East.<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>
Ethiopian, Persian, and Indian merchants scoured the
Gangetic Gulf, and, having loaded their vessels with aloes,
cloves, and sandalwood, obtained at Tranquebar and other
ports, returned to Siedeliba or Ceylon<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> to dispose of their
goods. There transhipments were effected, and sapphires,
pearls, and tortoise-shell, the chief exports of that island,
were added to the cargoes of ships westward bound. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187"> 187</span>
same market a limited supply of silk was obtained from such
Chinese merchants as were venturesome enough to sail so
far.<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> From Ceylon such vessels voyaged along the Malabar
coast between Cape Comorin and Sindu, near the mouth of
the Indus, receiving on board at various places supplies of
cotton and linen fabrics for clothing, copper and rare woods,
together with spices and aromatics, musk, castor, and
especially pepper. In the harbours of that seaboard they
also met with the merchants from Adule, most of whom
sailed no farther, and provided them with the freight for
their homeward voyage.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p>The traders of Axume were not, however, wholly dependent
for supplies on their intercourse with the Indies. Adjacent
to their own borders lay wide tracts of country which
were to them a fruitful source of the most valuable commodities;
and with such their ships were laden when outward
bound for the further East. Journeying to the south-east
they entered an extensive but wild region called Barbaria,<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a>
part of which was known as the Land of Frankincense,
from its peculiar fecundity in that odoriferous balsam. In
this region cinnamon and tortoise-shell were also obtained;
black slaves were purchased from various savage tribes;
elephants were hunted by the natives for food; and ivory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188"> 188</span>
was supplied in greatest quantity to the markets of the world.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>
Every other year a caravan of several hundred merchants
set out from Axume, well armed and equipped for a distant
expedition. For six months continuously they travelled
southward until they had penetrated far into the interior of
the African continent. Gold was the object of their journey,
and they took with them a herd of oxen as well as a quantity
of salt and iron to barter for the precious metal. On arriving
at the auriferous region they slaughtered the oxen and cut
up the flesh into joints which they arranged along with the
other objects of trade on the top of a specially erected barrier
formed of thorn bushes. They then retreated to some
distance, upon which the inhabitants, who had been watching
their proceedings, came forward and placed pellets of gold
on such lots as they wished to purchase. On the savages
retreating the traders again advanced and removed or left
the gold, according as they accepted or refused the amount
offered. In this way, after various advances and retreats, bargains
were satisfactorily concluded.<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> In the southern parts
of Arabia bordering on the ocean, myrrh and frankincense
were gathered in considerable quantity, whence the country
acquired the epithet of Felix or Happy.<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> The richest source<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189"> 189</span>
of emeralds lay in the uncivilized territory between Egypt
and Axume, where the mines were worked by a ferocious
tribe of nomads called Blemmyes. From them the Axumite
merchants obtained the gems, which they exported chiefly
to northern India. Amongst the White Huns, the dominant
race in that region, they were esteemed so highly that the
traders were enabled to load their ships with the proceeds
of a few of these precious stones.<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>Down the Red Sea to Adule resorted the Byzantine merchants,
engaged in the home trade, in great numbers.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> After
loading their vessels they again sailed northward, a proportion
of them to the small island of Jotabe,<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> situated near the
apex of the peninsula of Mount Sinai, which separated the
Elanitic from the Heroopolitan gulf. At a station there they
were awaited by the officials of the excise, who collected
from them a tenth part of the value of their merchandise.<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a>
Some of these ships proceeded up the eastern arm of the
sea to Elath; the rest of them chose the western inlet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190"> 190</span>
cast anchor at Clysma.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> The wares landed at these ports were
intended chiefly for the markets of Palestine and Syria.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> By
far the greater portion of the fleet, however, terminated their
northward voyage at Berenice,<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> the last port of Egypt, on the
same parallel with Syene. Here they discharged their cargoes
and transferred the goods to the backs of camels, who bore
them swiftly to the emporium of Coptos on the Nile.<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> A
crowd of small boats then received the merchandise and
made a rapid transit down stream to the Canopic arm of the
river, from which by canal they emerged on lake Mareotis,<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
the inland and busiest harbour of Alexandria. The maritime
traffic between the Egyptian capital and all other parts of
the Empire, Constantinople especially, was constant and
extensive, so that commodities could be dispersed from
thence in every direction with the greatest facility.</p>

<p>Within the Eastern Empire itself there were manufactories
for the fabrication of everything essential to the requirements
of civilized life, but production was much restricted by the
establishment universally of a system of monopolies. Several
of these were held by the government, who employed both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191"> 191</span>
men and women in the manufacture of whatever was necessary
to the Court and the army.<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> At Adrianople, Thessalonica,
Antioch, Damascus, and other towns, arms and armour were
forged, inlaid with gold when for the use of officers of rank;
the costly purple robes of the Imperial household emanated
from Tyre,<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> where dye-works and a fleet of fishing-boats for
collecting the murex were maintained; these industries were
strictly forbidden to the subject. There were, besides, at
Cyzicus<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> and Scythopolis,<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> official factories for the weaving
of cloth and linen. The military workshops were under the
direction of the Master of the Offices, the arts of peace under
that of the Count of the Sacred Largesses. Public manufacturers
or traders were incorporated in a college or guild
controlled by the latter Count, the privileges of which were
limited to some five or six hundred members.<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> Among the
staple productions of the Empire we find that Miletus<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> and
Laodicea<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> were famous for woollen fabrics, Sardes<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> especially
for carpets, Cos<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> for cotton materials, Tyre<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> and Berytus<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192"> 192</span>
for silks, Attica<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> and Samos<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> for pottery, Sidon<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> for glass,
Cibyra<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> for chased iron, Thessaly<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> for cabinet furniture,
Pergamus<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> for parchment, and Alexandria<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> for paper. The
fields of Elis were given over to the cultivation of flax,
and all the women at Patrae were engaged in spinning
and weaving it.<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> Hierapolis<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> in Phrygia was noted for its
vegetable dyes; and Hierapolis<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> in Syria was the great
rendezvous for the hunters of the desert, who captured wild
animals for the man and beast fights of the public shows.
Slave dealers, held to be an infamous class, infested the verge
of the Empire along the Danube, but at this date Romans
and barbarians mutually enslaved each other.<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> On this
frontier, also, consignments of amber and furs were received
from the shores of the Baltic and the Far North.<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> With
respect to articles of diet, almost every district produced wine,
but Lesbian and Pramnian were most esteemed.<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> A wide
tract at Cyrene was reserved for the growth of a savoury pot-herb,
hence called the Land of Silphium.<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> Egypt was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193"> 193</span>
granary of the whole Orient.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> Dardania and Dalmatia were
rich in cheese,<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> Rhodes<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> exported raisins and figs, Phoenicia<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>
dates, and the capital itself had a large trade in preserved
tunnies.<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<p>China was always topographically unknown to the ancients,
and about the sixth century only did they begin to discern
clearly that an ocean existed beyond it.<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> The country was
regarded as unapproachable by the Greek and Roman merchants,<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>
but nevertheless became recognized at a very early
period as the source of silk. Fully four hundred years before
the Christian era the cocoons were carried westward, and the
art of unwinding them was discovered by Pamphile of Cos,
one of the women engaged in weaving the diaphanous textiles
for which that island was celebrated.<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> Owing to the comparative
vicinity of the Persian and Chinese frontiers, the
silk exported by the Celestial Empire always tended to
accumulate in Persia, so that the merchants of that nation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194"> 194</span>
enjoyed almost a monopoly of the trade.<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> Hence Byzantine
commerce suffered severely during a Persian war, and strenuous
efforts would be made to supply the deficiency of silk
by stimulating its importation along the circuitous routes.
Such attempts, however, invariably proved ineffective<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> until
the invention of the compass and the discovery of the south-east
passage opened the navigation of the globe between the
nations of the East and West.</p>

<p>IV. In general condition the Byzantine people exhibit,
almost uniformly in every age, a picture of oppressed
humanity, devoid of either spirit or cohesion to nerve them
for a struggle to be free. With the experience of a thousand
years, the wisdom of Roman statesmen and jurists failed to
evolve a political system which could insure stability to
the throne or prosperity to the nation. Seditious in the
cities, abject in the country, ill-disciplined in the camp, unfaithful
in office, the subjects of the Empire never rose in
the social scale, but languished through many centuries to
extinction, the common grave of Grecian culture and Roman
prowess.</p>

<p>In the rural districts almost all the inhabitants, except the
actual landowners, were in a state of virtual slavery. The
labourers who tilled the soil were usually attached, with
their offspring, to each particular estate in the condition of
slaves or serfs. They could neither quit the land of their own
free will, nor could they be alienated from it by the owner,
but, if the demesne were sold, they were forced to pass with
it to the new master.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> The position of a serf was nominally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195"> 195</span>
superior to that of a slave, but the distinction was so little
practical that the lawyers of the period were unable to discriminate
the difference.<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> Any freeman who settled in a
neighbourhood to work for hire on an estate lost his liberty
and became a serf bound to the soil, unless he migrated again
before the expiration of thirty years.<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> The use and possession
of arms was interdicted to private persons throughout the
Empire, and only such small knives as were useless for
weapons of war were allowed to be exposed for sale.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<p>In every department of the State the same principle of
hereditary bondage was applied to the lower grades of the
service, and even in some cases to officials of considerable
rank. Here, however, a release was conceded to those who
could provide an acceptable substitute, a condition but rarely
possible to fulfil.<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> Armourers, mintmen, weavers, dyers,
purple-gatherers, miners, and muleteers, in government employ<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
could neither resign their posts nor even intermarry<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196"> 196</span>
with associates on a different staff, or the general public, unless
under restrictions which were almost prohibitive. Within the
same category were ruled the masters or owners of freight-ships,<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>
chartered to convey the annones and tributes, of which
the Alexandrian corn-fleet<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> constituted the main section.
Those addicted to this vocation in the public interest were
necessarily men of some private means, as they were obliged
to build and maintain the vessels at their own expense; but
they were rewarded by liberal allowances, and were almost
exempt in respect of the laws affecting the persons and
property of ordinary citizens. The lot of this class of the
community appears to have been tolerable, and was even,
perhaps, desirable,<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> but that of the Decurions, the members
of the local senates, was absolutely unbearable.<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> In relation
to their fellow townsmen their duties do not seem to have
been onerous, but as collectors of the revenue they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197"> 197</span>
made responsible for the full precept levied four-monthly on
each district, and had to make good any deficiency from
their own resources.<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> As natives of the locality to which their
activities were constrained, their intimate knowledge of the
inhabitants was invaluable to the government in its inquisitorial
and compulsive efforts to gather in the imposts; and,
subordinated to the Imperial officials resident in, or on special
missions to, the provinces, they became consequently the
prime object of their assaults when dealing with the defaulting
tributaries. In view of such hardships, municipal dignities
and immunities were illusory; and, as the local senates were
very numerous, there were few families among the middle
classes, from whom those bodies were regularly replenished,
whose members did not live in dread of a hereditary obligation
to become a Decurion. In every ordinary sphere of exertion,
not excepting the Court, the Church, or the army, men, long
embarked on their career, were liable to receive a mandate
enjoining them to return to their native town or village in
order to spend the rest of their lives in the management of
local affairs.<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Occupation of the highest offices of State, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198"> 198</span>
many years’ service in some official post, could alone free
them from the municipal bond.<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a></p>

<p>Life under accustomed conditions, though with restricted
liberty, may be supportable or even pleasant, but the Byzantine
subject could seldom realize the extent of his obligations
or foresee to what exactions he might have to submit. He
might review with satisfaction a series of admirable laws
which seemed to promise him tranquillity and freedom from
oppression, but experience soon taught him that it was against
the interest of the authorities to administer them with equity.
By an ineradicable tradition, dating from the first centuries of
the expansion of the Empire, it was presumed that the control
of a province offered a fair field to a placeman for enriching
himself.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> Hence the prevalence of a universal corruption
and a guilty collusion between the Rector and all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199"> 199</span>
lesser officials, who afforded him essential aid in his devices
for despoiling the provincials.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> While the fisc never scrupled
to aggravate the prescribed imposts by superindictions,<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> its
agents were insatiate in their efforts at harvesting for themselves.
The tyranny of the first emperors was local and
transient, but under the rule of the Byzantine princes the
vitals of the whole Empire were persistently sapped. In the
<i>adaeratio</i> of the annones a value was set upon the produce
far above the market price;<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> taxes paid were redemanded,
and receipts in proper form repudiated because the <i>tabellio</i>
who had signed them, purposely removed, was not present to
acknowledge his signature;<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> unexpected local rates were
levied, to which the assent of the Decurions was forced, with
the avowed object of executing public works which were
never undertaken;<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> sales of property at a vile estimate were
pressed on owners who dared not provoke the officials by a
refusal;<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> decisions in the law courts were ruled by bribery,
and suitors were overawed into not appealing against unjust
judgements;<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> forfeitures of estates to the crown were proclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200"> 200</span>
under pretence of lapse of ownership or questionable
right of inheritance, and their release had to be negotiated
for the payment of a sufficient ransom;<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> even special
grants from the Imperial treasury for reinstatement of fortifications
or other purposes were sometimes embezzled without
apprehension of more serious trouble, if detected, than
disgorgement.<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> In all these cases the excess extorted was
appropriated by the rapacious officials. Such were the hardships
inflicted systematically on the small proprietors who,
if unable to pay or considered to be recalcitrant, were not
seldom subjected to bodily tortures. For hours together
they were suspended by the thumbs,<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> or had to undergo the
application of finger-crushers or foot-racks,<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> or were beaten
on the nape of the neck with cords loaded with lead.<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>
Nevertheless, remainders accumulated constantly, and a remission
of hopeless arrears for a decade or more was often made
the instance of Imperial indulgence. But the old vouchers
were habitually secreted and preserved by the collectors so
that the ignorant rustics might be harassed persistently for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201"> 201</span>
debts which they no longer owed.<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> The existence of such
frauds was patent even to the exalted perceptions of the
Court; and hence Anastasius, in order to render his abolition
of the chrysargyron effective, resorted to an artifice
which appealed to the avarice of his financial delegates
throughout the country.<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> But an emperor, however well-intentioned,
could rarely attempt to lighten the burdens of
even the humblest of his subjects. His immediate ministers
had sold the chief posts in the provinces<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> and were under a
tacit convention to shield their nominees unless in the case
of some rash and flagrant delinquent who abandoned all
discretion. The public good was ignored in practice; to
keep the treasury full was the simple and narrow policy of
the Byzantine financier, who never fostered any enlightened
measure for making the Empire rich.<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> Zeno essayed to
remedy the widespread evil of venality, but his effort was
futile; although his constitution was re-enacted more than
once and permanently adorned the statute-book.<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202"> 202</span>
to this legislator every governor was bound to abide within
his province in some public and accessible place for fifty
days after the expiration of his term of office. Thus detained
within the reach of his late constituents when divested of
his authority, it was hoped that they would be emboldened
to come forward and call him to account for his misdeeds.
The reiteration of the law at no great intervals of time sufficiently
proves that it was promulgated only to be disregarded.<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a></p>

<p>Without legitimate protectors from whom they might seek
redress, the wretched tributaries either tried to match their
oppressors in craft, or yielded abjectly to all their demands.
Some parted with whatever they possessed, and finally sold
their sons and daughters into slavery or prostitution;<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> others
posted their holdings against the visits of the surveyors with
notices designating them as the property of some influential
neighbour.<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> Such local magnates, who maintained, perhaps,
a guard of Isaurian bandits, were wont to bid defiance to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203"> 203</span>
the law as well as to the lawlessness of the Rector and his
satellites.<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> To their protection, in many instances, the lesser
owners were impelled to consign themselves unconditionally,
hoping to find with them a haven of refuge against merciless
exaction. The patron implored readily accepted the trust,
but the suppliant soon discovered that his condition was
assimilated to that of a serf.<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> The web of social order was
strained or ruptured in every grade of life; traders joined
the ranks of the clergy in order to abuse the facilities for
commerce conceded to ministers of religion;<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> the proceedings
of the Irenarchs among the rustic population were so
vexatious, that they were accounted disturbers, instead of
guardians of the peace,<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> and the simple pastor had to be
denied the use of a horse, lest it should enable him to rob
with too much security on the public highways.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<h3 id="section_II_1">II. <span class="smcap">Educational</span></h3>

<p>Superstition flourishes because knowledge is still the
luxury of the few. By education alone can we hope to attain
to the extinction of that phase of mind termed belief, or
faith, which has always been inculcated as a virtue or a duty
by the priest, and condemned as a vice of the intellect by
the philosopher. In every age, the ability to discern the lines
of demarcation which separate the known from the unknown
is the initial stage of advancement; and in the training of
youth, the prime object of the educator should be to confer
this power on every individual; for in the uninformed minds
of a great majority of mankind, fact and fancy are for the
most part inextricably entangled. The efforts of authority
to dispel or perpetuate error are most potent when acting on
the impressionable faculties of early life. In a sane and progressive
world the first conception to be engrafted in the
expanding mind should be that knowledge has no foothold
beyond the causeways pushed by science into the ocean of
the unknown.<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205"> 205</span></p>

<p>I do not design to produce under this heading a lengthy
disquisition on paedagogics among the Byzantines, but
merely to indicate, by some broad lines, upon what stock of
common knowledge the foundations of civilization rested in
this age. The student of early Roman history will scarcely
need to be reminded that the virtues of the Republic were
not derived from the schools of art or philosophy; or that
the aesthetic tastes of those blunt citizens only developed in
proportion as they found themselves lords over the culture
as well as over the country of the Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> Towards the
middle of the second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Greek professors of literature
and eloquence began to establish themselves at Rome,
where they held their ground for some decades on a very
precarious footing, owing to the strong disfavour with which
they were regarded by those who considered the preservation
of ancient manners as the salvation of the state.<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> Gradually,
however, the new discipline prevailed; eminent teachers
were accorded recognition by the government, and before
the end of the first century <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, the privilege of maintaining
at the public expense a faculty of professors to impart higher
instruction to the rising generation, was granted to every
town of any magnitude throughout the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> To facilitate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206"> 206</span>
therefore, the prosecution of <i>liberal studies</i>, for such they
were officially named, suitable buildings were erected in
every populous centre. Architecturally, a state school comprised
a handsome hall or lecture theatre, with class-rooms
attached, the whole being surrounded essentially by a portico.<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>
The extent and decorative elaboration of these edifices
depended doubtless on their local or general importance.
The greater institutions, as denoted by their being the resort
of a large concourse of students, were liberally provided with
the adornments of painting and statuary.<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> Objective instruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207"> 207</span>
was given by means of tabular expositions of the subjects
taught affixed to the walls of the colonnades, among which
maps conveying not only geographical, but also historical
information, were particularly conspicuous.<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> Until the barbarian
invasion of Greece by Alaric at the close of the fourth
century, Athens maintained an easy pre-eminence as a centre
of polite learning, and bestowed the greatest prestige on
those who passed through her schools.<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> The most pronounced
effort for the advancement of higher education in
the East at this epoch was the definite constitution of the
schools of Constantinople in an Auditorum on the Capitol,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208"> 208</span>
almost as the counterpart of a modern University, by Theodosius
II, in 425. The teaching staff of this college consisted,
under their official titles, of three Orators and ten Grammarians
for the Latin language; of five Sophists and ten
Grammarians for the Greek tongue; of one Philosopher; and
of two Jurists, thirty-one members in all.<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> To insure the
success of this foundation, the decree for its establishment
was accompanied by an injunction against the public lecturing
of professors other than those appointed to hold forth
within its walls.<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> A body of scriveners, technically named
antiquarians, was also maintained for the multiplication of
copies of manuscripts in the public libraries of the capital,
which were rich in literature.<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></p>

<p>In addition to these teachers, who were settled in various
localities, the itinerant professor, who travelled from place
to place delivering public harangues and taking pupils for
a short course of instruction, was a feature in the life of the
period. With considerable vanity they distinguished themselves
by wearing a long beard, carrying a staff, and enfolding
themselves in a cloak of an unusual tint.<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> Rhetoricians
affected a garb of scarlet or white, philosophers of gray, and
physicians of blue.<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> When addressing an audience, they
usually presented themselves crowned with flowers, reeking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209"> 209</span>
with perfumes, and displaying a gold ring of remarkable
size.<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> The advent of these self-ordained instructors of the
public into a provincial town was often the occasion of much
local enthusiasm, and a throng of citizens advanced to meet
them for some distance, in order to conduct them to their
lodgings.<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> All professors, whether in the pay of the state or
otherwise, enjoyed a complete immunity from the civil duties
and imposts enforced on ordinary individuals, thus presenting
the singular contrast of being licensed to live in a condition
of ideal freedom under a political system which
restricted personal liberty at every turn.<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> Such material
advantages inevitably became liable to abuse through imposture,
and the country was permeated by charlatans in
the guise of philosophers, who coveted distinction and
emolument at the easy price of a merely personal assertion
of competence.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> In the fourth century this evil was scarcely
checked by Imperial enactments which required that professors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210"> 210</span>
of every grade should procure credentials as to character
and attainments from the Curia of their native place.<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>
The cost of education is a somewhat obscure subject, but we
are justified in assuming that all the state seminaries were
open gratuitously to the youth of the district; and we know
that even private teachers of eminence were accustomed to
remit the fees to students who were unable to pay.<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></p>

<p>The ancients, like the moderns, assigned certain courses
of instruction to pupils according to their age and the estimated
development of their intelligence. As with us, the
recipient of a full liberal education passed through three
stages, adapted respectively to the capacity of the child, the
boy, and the youth, which may be discussed under the headings
of Elementary, Intermediate, and Final. To these must
necessarily be added, in the case of those destined for a
special vocation, a fourth stage, viz., the Professional. Their
conception, however, of the periods of early life was more
defined, and differed somewhat from our own, the first terminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211"> 211</span>
at twelve, the second at fourteen, the third at
twenty, and the fourth at twenty-five years of age.<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> Primary
education began at from five to seven, and the pupils were
usually sent to a day-school in the charge of a slave, named
a paedagogue. There they were taught to read, write, and to
count; and suitable pieces were given to them to learn by
rote. A wooden tablet faced with wax, upon which they
scratched with a style, took the place of the modern slate or
copy-book. Calculation was restricted to some simple operations
of mental arithmetic, owing to the cumbersome method
of figuring employed by the ancients, which did not lend
itself easily to the manipulation of written numbers.<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> The
schoolmasters who presided over such preparatory establishments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212"> 212</span>
did not rank as professors, and were not accorded any
privileges beyond those of ordinary citizens.<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>II. At twelve the work of mental cultivation commenced
seriously, and the pupil entered on the study of the <i>seven
liberal arts</i>, viz., grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, geometry,
arithmetic, astronomy, and music.<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> These subjects were
taken in two stages, which in the West were beginning to be
called the <i>Trivium</i> and <i>Quadrivium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> Two years were devoted
to the <i>Trivium</i>, the scope of which may be apprehended
from a brief summary. 1. The grammar of the
period dealt with the eight parts of speech in a sufficiently
exhaustive manner; conveyed some notions, often crude
and erroneous, as to the derivation of words; and, in the
absence of precise anatomical or acoustic science, attempted
in a primitive fashion a classification of the letters and a
physiology of vocalization. The construction of sentences
was analyzed with considerable minuteness; and passages
selected from eminent writers were set for the student to
parse with an exactitude seldom called for at the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213"> 213</span>
day.<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> The laws of poetical metre were taught as a leading
branch of the subject; and a familiarity with literature was
promoted by reading the best authors, especially Homer.<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
The copious Latin grammarian Priscian flourished at Constantinople
under Anastasius, and his monumental work in
eighteen books is still extant.<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a></p>

<p>2. In the province of dialectics it was sought to instill the
art of reasoning correctly into the mind of the pupil. Thus
he was introduced to the elementary principles of logic; the
categories, or the modes of regarding and classifying phenomena,
were explained to him; and he was exercised in
the practice of accurate deduction according to the various
forms of the syllogism.</p>

<p>3. Without a practical acquaintance with the art of rhetoric
it was considered that no one could pretend to occupy any
desirable position in the civil service of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> This
course was the extension and application of the two previous
ones of grammar and logic, upon which it was based. The
rules of composition and the arts of argument, which the
ingenuity of the Greeks had unravelled and defined under a
hundred apposite names, were exemplified to the student,<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214"> 214</span>
who wrote extracts to dictation chosen from various illustrative
authors. The sophist or rhetorician addressed his class
on some stated theme, and spoke alternately on both sides
of the question. The management of the voice and the use
of appropriate gesture were systematically taught.<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> Finally
the pupils were set to compose speeches of their own and
to debate among themselves on suitable subjects.<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></p>

<p>III. The four divisions of the <i>Quadrivium</i> were grouped
together as the mathematical arts; and six years were allotted
to their study. 1. In geometry the discipline did not include
the learning of theorems and problems as set forth in the
Elements of Euclid, but merely an acquaintance with the
definitions and with the ordinary plane and solid figures.<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a>
The teaching in this section, however, was mainly of geography.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>
It was asserted doubtfully that the earth was a
globe and that there was an inferior hemisphere of which
nothing certain could be predicated.<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215"> 215</span></p>

<p>2. Arithmetic was not practised methodically by the
setting of sums to be worked out by the pupils, but consisted
chiefly in demonstrating the more obvious properties
of numbers, such as odd, even, prime, perfect, etc., together
with many fanciful absurdities.<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> Operations with figures
were indicated verbally in a disconnected manner; multiplication
tables to be learnt by heart had not been invented;
the higher rules and decimal fractions were unknown.</p>

<p>3. Systematic astronomy at this period and for long after,
as is well known, was conceived of on false principles which,
whilst admitting of the correct solution of some problems,
such as the prediction of eclipses, left the vastness of the
universe and its physical constitution totally unapprehended.
All the heavenly bodies were regarded as mathematically, if
not teleologically disposed about the earth, to which as a
centre even the fixed stars, at varying and immeasurable
distances as they are, were constrained fantastically by a revolving
sphere of crystal.<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> The reasoning, however, by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216"> 216</span>
these views were upheld was not sufficiently convincing to
gain universal acceptance; and the outlines of the science
communicated to students generally received some modifications
from the minds of individual teachers.<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> Much of the
course was taken up with treating of the constellations and
the zodiac, not without a tincture of astrology, and some
primitive observations on meteorology were included.<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<p>4. Music as known to us is virtually a modern creation;
and that of the Greeks would doubtless impress us as a wild
and disorderly performance, adapted only to the ears of
some semi-barbaric people of the East. Their most extended
scale did not range beyond eighteen notes;<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> in order to
obtain variety their only resource was a shift of key, that is,
a change of pitch, or the adoption of a different mode, that
is, of a gamut in which the semitones assumed novel positions;
and their harmony was restricted to the consonance of octaves.
Time was not measured according to the modern
method, but there was a rhythm fixed in relation to the
various metres of poetic verse. Their usual instruments
were the pipe or flute, the lyre, a simple form of organ,<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> and,
of course, the human voice. Practically, therefore, their
music consisted of melody of a declamatory or recitatival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217"> 217</span>
type, to which a peculiar character was sometimes given by
the use of quarter tones; and choral singing was purely
symphonic. But the vibrational numbers of the scale had
been discovered by Pythagoras when making experiments
with strings; and each of the eighteen notes and fifteen
modes had received a descriptive name. Hence the limited
scope of the art did not prevent the theory of music from
ultimately becoming elaborated with a complexity not unworthy
of the native subtlety of the Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> In practice the
musical training of pupils consisted in their learning to sing
to the lyre.<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a></p>

<p>Such in brief were the component parts of a liberal education,
with which, however, under the name of philosophy, it
was considered essential that a complement of ethical teaching
should be conjoined. This complement was digested
into three branches, under which were discussed the duty of
the individual to himself, to the household, and to the community
at large or to the state.<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218"> 218</span></p>

<p>IV. It now remains for us to glance at the more protracted
training of those who had resolved to devote their
lives to some particular sphere of activity. Aspirants for the
position of professor of the liberal arts, or who wished to
utilize their acquirements in a political career, would continue
and extend their studies on the lines above indicated;
but those who intended to follow the professions of law or
physic, or engage in practice of art proper, had to direct
their energies into new channels.</p>

<p>1. As the administration of the Empire was almost
monopolized by the members of the legal profession, it may
be inferred that the throng of youths intent on becoming
lawyers fully equalled in number the students of every other
calling. Hence we find that not only were schools of law
established in every city of importance, notably Constantinople,
Alexandria, and Caesarea, but that a provincial town
of minor rank obtained a unique celebrity through the teaching
of jurisprudence. Berytus, on the Syrian coast, in the
province of Phoenicia, with an academic history of several
centuries<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> at this date, had attained to that position; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219"> 219</span>
was habitually spoken of as the “mother” and “nurse of
the laws.”<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Four jurists of eminence, double the number
allotted to any other school, under the title of Antecessors,
lectured in the auditorium;<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> and a progressive course of
study was arranged to extend over five years. In each successive
year the candidate assumed a distinctive designation
which marked his seniority or denoted the branch of law on
which he was engaged.<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> Before the sixth century the legal
archives of the Empire had been swollen to such proportions
that it had become an almost impossible task to thread the
maze of their innumerable enactments. During the lapse of a
thousand years the constitutions of the emperors had been engrafted
on the legislation of the Republic, and the complexity
of the resultant growth was capable of bewildering the most
acute of legal minds. On three occasions, beginning from
the time of Constantine, attempts had been made to separate
and classify the effective laws;<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> and the Code of Theodosius
II, published in 438, the only official one, was at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220"> 220</span>
present in force. But this work, executed in a narrow spirit
of piety which decreed that only the enactments of Christian
emperors should be included, was universally recognized as
both redundant and insufficient. A still wider entanglement
existed in the literature which had accumulated around the
interpretation and application of the statutes; during the
administration of justice a myriad of perplexing points had
arisen to exercise the keenest forensic judgement in order to
arrive at equitable decisions; and it was estimated that two
thousand treatises, emanating from nearly forty authors, contained
in scattered passages matter essential to a correct apprehension
of the principles and practice of the law.<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> Such
was the arduous prospect before a legal student who desired
to win a position of repute in his profession.<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p>2. As Berytus had become famous for its law school, so
Alexandria, and even some centuries earlier, had gained a
noted pre-eminence as a centre of medical education;<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> but
with respect to the course of study and the methods of instruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221"> 221</span>
no details have come down to us. We have seen
that the regulations for the establishment of the auditorium
at Constantinople did not provide for a chair of physic,
whence it may be inferred that it was left entirely to those
who had attained to the position of senior or arch-physician
to organize the teaching and training of pupils. The public
medical officers, who attended the poor at their own homes
or in the <i>nosocomia</i> or hospitals existing at this date,<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> would
doubtless have excellent opportunities for forming classes
and rendering students familiar with the aspect and treatment
of disease. The medical and surgical science of
antiquity had come to a standstill by the end of the second
century, when the indefatigable Galen composed his great
repertory of the knowledge of his own times. That knowledge
comprised almost all the details of macroscopic anatomy,
but had advanced but a little way towards solving the physiological
problems as to the working of the vital machine.
The gross absurdities of the preceding centuries had, however,
been finally disposed of, such as that fluids passed
down the windpipe into the lungs,<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> or that the arteries contained
air.<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> Ordinary operations were performed freely; and
the surgeon was conscious that it was more creditable to
save a limb than to amputate it.<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> Three centuries before
the Christian era Theophrastus had laid the foundations of
systematic botany, as had his master Aristotle those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222"> 222</span>
zoology and comparative anatomy.<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> The resources of therapeutics
were extensive and varied, but the action of drugs
was not well understood. Remedies were compounded not
only from the vegetable kingdom, but also with animal substances<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
to an extent which seems likely to be equalled by
the more precise medication with the principles of living
tissues gaining ground at the present day. Knowledge of
minerals, however, was too deficient for such bodies to take
a prominent place in pharmacology.<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a></p>

<p>3. The arts of Greece, after having flourished in perfection
from the time of Pericles to that of Alexander in the various
departments of architecture, sculpture, painting, and literature,
remained dormant for some centuries until the establishment
of universal peace under the dominion of Rome
provided a new theatre for their exercise. Fostered in the
Augustan age by the indolence and luxury of the Imperial
city, which offered the prospect of fortune to every artist of
ambition and talent, they were communicated to the Latins,
who strove earnestly to imitate and equal their masters. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223"> 223</span>
exotic art bloomed on the foreign soil to which it had been
transplanted; and the Italians, if they never displayed
creative genius or originality of conception, at least learned
to reproduce with consummate skill and novelty of investment
the emanations of Hellenic inspiration. But the
elements of permanency were wanting to such factitious
aptitudes, as they were in fact to the fabric of the Empire
itself; and the wave of political stability was closely followed
in its rise and fall by the advance or decline of the arts.
After the reign of Augustus the tide of prosperity ebbed for
about half a century until it reached its lowest level during
the Civil Wars which heralded the settlement of Vespasian
on the throne. It rose again, and for more than fifty years
maintained an active flow during the reigns of Trajan and
Hadrian, subsequent to which its course is marked by a
gently descending line, under the benign rule of the
Antonines, until it sinks somewhat abruptly in the temporary
dissolution of the Empire, which preceded the triumph of
Severus. Thenceforward, but two centuries from its foundation,<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>
the sovereignty of Rome entered on shoals and quicksands,
calamity succeeded calamity, and a position of stable
equilibrium was never afterwards regained; but in the
vicissitudes of fortune before the final catastrophe, an illusive
glow appeared to signalize more than once a return of the
supremacy of the Caesars.<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224"> 224</span></p>

<p>By the time of Constantine the neglect and degradation
of art had become so pronounced that artists could scarcely
be found competent to execute, even in an inferior style,
any monumental record of the events of the age; or for the
construction of the public buildings so lavishly planned by
that monarch in his attempted renovation of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>
To meet the difficulty he promulgated decrees, which were
kept in force and multiplied by his successors, with the view
of stimulating his subjects to devote themselves to arts and
the allied handicrafts. Immunity from all civil burdens
was guaranteed; and salaries, with the free occupation of
suitable premises in public places, were offered to those who
would undertake to teach.<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> These measures undoubtedly
tended to the elevation of taste and the maintenance of
civilization, although they could not infuse a new genius
into the people of a decadent age.</p>

<p>At the opening of the sixth century Constantinople was
the focus of civilization not only in the East, but also with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225"> 225</span>
respect to those western countries which had until lately been
united as members of the same political system. The
suzerainty of the eastern Emperor was still tacitly allowed,
or, at least, upheld; and the prestige of his capital was felt
actively throughout the ruder West as a refining influence
which only waned after the period of the Renaissance. The
main characteristic of art at this epoch is an unskilled imitation
of ancient models; and the conventional style regarded
as typically Byzantine, which at one time prevailed so widely
in Europe, was not to become apparent for many centuries
to come.<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> But by the fifth century certain modifications of
design, betraying the infiltration of Oriental tastes, also began
to be observable.<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></p>

<p><i>a.</i> Architecture at Constantinople remained essentially
Greek, or, at least, Graeco-Roman; and the constant demand
for new buildings, especially churches, ordained that
it should still be zealously studied. In the provinces, however,
particularly on the Asiatic side, some transitional examples
would have enabled an observer to forecast already
an era of cupolar construction.<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226"> 226</span></p>

<p><i>b.</i> On the other hand, statuary almost threatened to become
a lost art. The devotion to athletic contests, which
prevailed among the Greeks, caused them to lay great stress
on physical culture; and at the public games, as well as in
the preparatory gymnasia, they were constantly familiarized
with the aspect of the human figure undraped in every phase
of action and repose.<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> The eye of the artist thus acquired a
precision which enabled him to execute works in marble
with a perfection unapproached in any later age. To the
anthropomorphic spirit of polytheism it was necessary that
the images of the gods should be multiplied in temples and
even in public places; and the Greeks essayed to express
the ideal beauty of their divinities under those corporeal
forms which appeared most exquisite to the human senses.
Received as being of both sexes and as fulfilling the conception
of faultless excellence in a variety of spheres, a
boundless field lay open before the artist in which to represent
them according to their diverse attributes of sovereignty,
of intellect, or of grace.<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> But the traditions of Hebrew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227"> 227</span>
monotheism sternly forbid any material presentation of the
Deity, and sculpture in the round was almost abolished at
the advent of Christianity. In one minor department, however,
that of ivory carving, a school of artists was constantly
exercised in order to provide the annual batch of consular
diptychs, which it was customary to distribute throughout
the provinces every new year.<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> On each set of these plates,
figured in low relief, appeared generally duplicate likenesses
of the consul of the day, clad in his state robes and surrounded
by subsidiary designs. The style of these productions,
perfunctorily executed it may be, suggests that the
average artist of the period was incapable of portraiture or
of tracing correctly the lines of any living form.<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></p>

<p><i>c.</i> Less unfortunate with reference to religion were the
pictorial arts at this date. The decoration of churches, in
brilliant colour and appropriate iconography, was gradually
carried to a degree of elaboration which has never since been
surpassed. The intrinsic nature of popular devotion insensibly
established the convention that images in the flat did
not contravene the divine prohibitions; and ecclesiastical
prejudice yielded to expediency. On the iconostasis and
around the walls of the sacred edifice, in proximity to the
worshippers, Christ, the Virgin, the Apostles, and the Saints,
with many a scene of Gospel history, were depicted in glowing
tints on a blue or a golden ground. On every available
space of the ceiling similar subjects, but of larger dimensions,
were executed in a brilliant glass mosaic, and the
mass of colour overhead completed the gorgeous effect of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228"> 228</span>
the interior.<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> Accordantly it was considered that reverence
for the holy scriptures was fittingly shown by the reproduction
of copies in the most costly form; and hence the
painting of manuscripts in miniature revived and endured
as one of the staple industries of the age. But in all these
cases defective drawing and perspective are often painfully
conspicuous, and a meretricious display of colour seems
to be regarded by the artist as the highest expression of his
skill.<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a></p>

<p><i>d.</i> By the end of the fifth century we are on the verge of
that new era in literature, introduced by the Byzantines,
when to make a transcript of some previous writer was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229"> 229</span>
become an author.<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> In other branches of art from time to
time some obvious merit becomes visible on the surface, but
in the domain of poetry, during nearly fourteen centuries
previous to the fall of the Empire, a single name only, that
of Claudian, survives to remind us that both Greeks and
Latins once possessed the faculty of expressing themselves
in verse with nobility of thought and felicity of diction.
Poetasters existed in abundance, but without exception their
compositions exemplify the futility of striving after an object
which in that age had resolved itself into the unattainable.
The usefulness of prose as a medium of information, however
low may be its literary level, often compensates us for
lack of talent in an author; and the bald chronicler, who
plagiarized his predecessors in the same field and presented
their work as his own, is sometimes as welcome to the investigator
as a writer of more ambitious aims. In these barren
centuries, however, history and theology are occasionally
illustrated by some work of original power.</p>

<p>In the foregoing paragraphs I have dealt with education
in relation only to the male sex, and it remains for me to
say a few words respecting the mental training of the female.
In keeping with the rule as to their social seclusion, the
instruction of girls was conducted in the privacy of the family
circle. There they received, in addition to the usual rudiments,
a certain tincture of polite learning, which implied
the methodical reading of Homer and a limited acquaintance
with some of the other Greek poets and the dramatists.<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230"> 230</span>
Music, as being an elegant accomplishment, was also taught
to them.<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> They were not, however, debarred from extending
the scope of their studies, and instances of learned ladies are
not altogether wanting to this age, for example, the Empress
Athenais or Eudocia<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> and the celebrated Hypatia.<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

<p>A glance at the slight structure of knowledge, the leading
lines of which I have just lightly traced, may enable the
modern reader to appreciate the conditions of intellectual life
among the ancients, and to perceive within how narrow an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231"> 231</span>
area was confined the exercise of their reasoning faculties.
Viewed in comparison with the vast body of contemporary
science, all the information acquired by the Greeks must
appear as an inconsiderable residue scarcely capable of conveying
a perceptible tinge to the whole mass. For fully
eighteen hundred years, from the age of Aristotle to that of
Columbus and Copernicus, no advance was made in the
elucidation of natural phenomena or even towards exploring
the surface of the globe. The same globe has been surveyed
and delineated in its widest extent by the industry of our
cartographers, has been seamed with a labyrinth of railways
for the conveyance of substance, and invested in a network
of wire for the transmission of thought. In the universe of
suns our solar system appears to us as a minute and isolated
disc, the earth a speck within that disc; to the ancients the
revelations of telescopic astronomy were undreamt of, and
the world they inhabited (all but a tithe of which was concealed
from them, and whose form they only mistily realized)
seemed to them to be the heart of the universe, of which the
rest of the celestial bodies were assumed to be merely subordinate
appendages. Geological investigation has penetrated
the past history of the earth through a million of centuries to
those primeval times when meteorological conditions first
favoured the existence of organic life; the people of antiquity
were blinded by unfounded legends which antedated the
origin of things to a few thousand years before their own age.
Spectroscopic observation has assimilated the composition
of the most distant stars to that of our own planet. Chemical
analysis has achieved the dissolution of the numberless
varieties of matter presented to our notice, and proved them
to arise merely from diverse combinations of a few simple
elements; and electrical research has almost visually approached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232"> 232</span>
that primordial substance in which is conceived to
exist the ultimate unity of all things.<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> Synthetical chemistry
has acquired the skill to control the inherent affinities of
nature, and to compel her energies to the production of
myriads of hitherto unknown compounds.<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> By the aid of the
microscope we can survey the activities of those otherwise
invisible protoplasmic cells which lie at the foundation of
every vital process; and the possibility is foreshadowed that,
in the alliance of biology and chemistry, we may one day
succeed in crossing the bridge which links the organic to the
inorganic world and command the beginnings of life.<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> In all
these departments of objective knowledge the speculations
and researches of the Greek philosophers had not even broken
the ground. For these primitive observers, without history
and without science, the world was a thing of yesterday, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233"> 233</span>
novel appearance of which almost anything might be affirmed
or denied. Magnetism was known merely as an interesting
property of the lodestone; electricity, as yet unnamed, had
barely arrested attention as a peculiarity of amber, when
excited by friction, to attract light substances. Nor had the
mechanical arts been developed so as to admit of any practical
application and stimulate the industries of civilization.
Although automatic toys were sometimes constructed with
considerable ingenuity,<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> the simplest labour-saving machine
was as yet uninvented.<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> In the early centuries of our era
knowledge had become stagnant, and further progress was
not conceived of. One half of the world lived on frivolity;
the individuality of the other half was sunk in metaphysical
illusion. The people of this age contemplated nature without
comprehending her operations; her forces were displayed
before their eyes, but it never entered into their heads to
master them and make them subservient to the needs of
human life; they moved within a narrow cage unconscious
of the barriers which confined them, without a thought of
emerging to the freedom of the beyond; and an ordinary
citizen of the present day is in the possession of information
which would surprise and instruct the greatest sage of ancient
Greece.</p>


<h3 id="section_III_1">III. <span class="smcap">Religious.</span></h3>

<p>The increase of knowledge in the nineteenth century has
stripped every shred of supernaturalism from our conception
of popular religions. The studies and inventions of modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234"> 234</span>
science have illuminated every corner of the universe; and
our discovery of the origins has cleared the greatest stumbling-block
from the path of philosophy and removed the last prop
which sustained the fabric of organized superstition. The
world will one day have to face the truth about religion; and
it may then become necessary to restrain by legal enactment
those who would draw away the masses to some old historical,
or to some new-born superstition.<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a></p>

<p>In primitive times the curiosity and impatience of mankind
demanded an immediate explanation of the activities of
nature; and by a simple analogy they soon conceived the
existence of a demiurge or maker of worlds who, in his loftier
sphere, disposed of the materials of the universe by methods
comparable to those of their own constructive operations.<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235"> 235</span>
Or, perchance, by even less speculative reasoning they were
led to accept the phenomenal world as the result of a perpetual
generation and growth which accorded closely with
their everyday experience of nature; whilst a divinity of some
kind seemed to lurk in every obscurity and all visible objects
to be instinct with a life and intelligence of their own.<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> In
either case they believed themselves to be in the presence of
beings of superior attributes whom it was desirable or necessary
to conciliate by some form of address adapted to gain
their favour or to avert their enmity. Hence worship, the
parent of some system of ritual likely to become more elaborate
in the lapse of time; and the ultimate establishment of
a priestly caste who would soon profess to an intercourse
with the unseen not vouchsafed to ordinary mortals. Gradually
the first vague notions of a celestial hierarchy grew more
realistic by imaginative or expedient accretions; and in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236"> 236</span>
later age the sense of a less ignorant community would not
be revolted by incredible details as to the personal intervention
of divinities in the history of their progenitors when such
events were relegated to a dimly realized past. But, although
a belief in revelation as seen through the mists of antiquity
prevails readily at all times among the unthinking masses, a
spirit of scepticism and inquiry arises with the advent of
civilization and increases concurrently with the vigour of its
growth. Then the national mythology is submitted to the
test of a dispassionate logic, and its crude constituents become
more and more rejected by the sagacity of a cultured class.
They, however, always hitherto an inconsiderable minority,
feel constrained to an indulgence more or less qualified of
the superstitions of the vulgar for fear of disturbing the
political harmony of the state.</p>

<p>The early Greek philosophers awoke into life to find
themselves endowed with vast intelligence in a world of
which they knew nothing. No record of the past, no forecast
of the future disturbed the serenity of their intellectual
horizon. In a more aesthetic environment they renewed
the impulse to interpret nature with a finer sense of congruity
than was possessed by their rude ancestors, but their
methods were identical, and they believed they could advance
beyond the bounds of experience by the exercise
of a vivid imagination. The coarse myths of polytheism
were thrust aside, and the void was filled with fantastic
cosmogonies, some of which included, whilst others
dispensed with, the agency of a Deity.<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> The truth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237"> 237</span>
finality of such speculations was shortly assumed, and schools
of philosophy, representing every variety of doctrine, were
formed, except that in which it was foreseen that knowledge
would be attained only by the long and laborious path of
experimental investigation. But whilst disciples were attracted
to different sects by the personal influence of a
teacher, by the novelty of his tenets, or by their own mental
bias, the general sense of the community remained unconvinced;
and the independent thinkers of the next generation
perceived the futility of inquiries which evolved nothing
coherent and revealed no new facts. Scientific research, for
the deliberate striving after deeper insight ranked as such
in the unpractised mind of the period, was discredited, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238"> 238</span>
an impression that the limits of human knowledge had
already been reached began to prevail universally. A reign
of scepticism was inaugurated, the evidence of the senses
in respect even of the most patent facts was doubted, and
the study of nature was virtually abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> Then philosophy
became synonymous with ethics, but by ethics was
understood merely the rule of expediency in public life, a
subject which was debated with much sophistry. The inspiration
of Socrates impelled him to combat this tendency,
to search earnestly after truth, and to inculcate an elevated
sense of duty. His mind was pervaded by an intense philanthropy
which affected his associates so profoundly that
his teaching did not lose its influence for centuries after his
death. From the time of Socrates the fruits of experience
began to be gathered, and new schools of philosophy were
organized on the sounder basis of divulging to their votaries
how to make the best use of their lives. The views entertained
on this question were as various as the divergences
of human temperament, and adapted to countenance the
serious or the frivolous proclivities of mankind.<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> A theological
or cosmical theory was a usual part of the equipment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239"> 239</span>
of these schools, but in outward demeanour they conformed,
more or less strictly, with the religion of the state. The
intellectual movement among the Greeks culminated after
about two centuries of activity in the career of Aristotle,
who undertook to sift, to harmonize, and to codify all the
knowledge of his age.<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> A great work had been accomplished;
all that wild outgrowth with which savage intellection
is wont to encumber the domain of reason had been
swept away, and the ground had been subjected to an
orderly, though unproductive planting. The conception that
nature would yield a harvest as the reward of rational study
had been awakened, but the efforts lapsed because the
method had yet to be discovered of fertilizing the vacant
soil.<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

<p>The conception of social ethics or of mutual obligation
among the members of a community appears to have been
one of those influences which presided at the birth of civilization,
and to have attained theoretical perfection far back
in the prehistoric past; whilst the perpetual conflict between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240"> 240</span>
duty and individual advantage has always inhibited altruism
from being accepted as an invariable guide to conduct
without the artificial support of penal law. In Homer and
Hesiod we find almost every rule for living uprightly adequately
expressed. A man should honour his parents,
love and be generous to his friends, be a good neighbour,
and succour strangers and suppliants. He should be truthful,
honest, continent, and industrious; and should consider
sloth to be a disgrace.<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> In the next age Hellenic
refinement could add little more than fuller expression to
these simple precepts. But from Pythagoras to Socrates,
from Aristotle to Cicero, from Seneca to Marcus Aurelius,
a constant emission of ethical doctrine was maintained.
Amid the wealth of disquisition, innumerable striking aphorisms
might be selected, but only a few such can be recorded
here: We should scan the actions of each day before
resigning ourselves to sleep;<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> We have contracted with the
government under which we live to submit ourselves to its
laws, even should they condemn us to death unjustly;<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> We
should pity the man who inflicts an injury more than him
who suffers it, for the one is harmed only in his body, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241"> 241</span>
other in his more precious soul;<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> Do not unto others what
it angers you to suffer yourself;<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> Even should we be able
to conceal our conduct from gods and men, we are not the
less bound to act uprightly;<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a> The judge, as well as the
criminal, is on his trial that he may deliver just decisions;<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a>
Do not revile the malefactor, but commiserate him as one
who knows not right from wrong;<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> Blame none, for men
only do evil involuntarily.<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> By the first century slaves had
begun to be considered in a more humane light; and
masters were enjoined to look on them as humble friends, as
brothers with whom it was no disgrace to sit at meat.<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> The
iniquity of the gladiatorial shows was beginning to be felt
in the time of Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a> and they were denounced in no
measured terms by Seneca.<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> Such exhibitions had never
been proper to the Greek communities and, when an attempt
was made to introduce them at Athens in the second
century, the cynic philosopher Demonax restrained his
fellow citizens by declaring that before doing so they should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242"> 242</span>
first demolish the altar of Pity.<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> The exposure of new-born
infants was one of the besetting sins of antiquity, and the
practice was universal among the Latins and Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> The
inhumanity of it was, however, perceived early in our era;
yet not until the reign of Severus do we find a legal pronouncement
against it.<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> Constantine discountenanced it,
but no comprehensive enactment for its suppression was
promulgated till the end of the fourth century.<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> Charity
towards the needy was a recognized duty from the earliest
times, and Homer voices the general sentiment when he
writes that strangers and the poor are to be treated as
emissaries from the gods.<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a> At Athens, in its palmy days,
an allowance was made to indigent citizens;<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> and the lavish
system of outdoor relief denoted by the trite phrase, <i>Panem
et circenses</i>, as introduced by the Caesars, threatened to
pauperize the urban population of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> The origin
of charitable asylums is not well ascertained, but there is
evidence that in the first century at least the foundation of
such institutions was already being promoted by the rulers
of the state.<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> The Roman Empire entered the Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243"> 243</span>
era equipped with a civilization scarcely at all inferior to
that of the present day in relation to art, literature, and
social ethics, but a sustaining principle, which could endow
the splendid fabric with quality of permanency, was wanting.
It was vulnerable within and without; and two powerful
enemies, superstition and the barbarian, were awaiting
the opportune moment to prey upon it. The dissolution
commenced within; ignorance of natural science allowed
the first to work havoc in its vital parts; the barbarian
assaulted the infected mass from without, and the ruin became
complete.</p>

<p>The political unification of the most civilized portion of
the globe was begun by the conquests of Alexander and completed
by those of Rome. Sociological homogeneity was attendant
on centralization of government. From Britain to
North Africa and from Spain to Asia Minor thought flowed
through the same channels. Rome and Greece dominated
the world between them; while the former assumed the
physical control of the nations, the latter held their mental
faculties in subjection. Progressively, however, influences
began to permeate the Empire which were foreign to both
Latins and Hellenes. East and west confronted each other
on the Asiatic frontier; Egyptians and Jews were commingled
with the Latin and Greek races in the great mart of Alexandria.
Oriental mysticism became rife, and gods of every
nationality were received into the bosom of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244"> 244</span>
first century of the Christian era the times were ripe for new
religious beliefs. By the expansion of the Roman dominions
the classes had become cosmopolitan, and a wide experience
of men and manners had dissipated the rustic simplicity of
the Republic. The society of the Empire was enlightened
by the speculations of Greek philosophy; it became versed
in metaphysical discussion, and soon conceived an irreverence
for the divinities of a ruder age.<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> Everywhere the same level of
mental apprehension was ultimately reached. Then the inanity
of earthly existence began to be acutely felt. The thoughtful
looked through the void and saw nowhere for the mind to
rest. Zeal for public distinction had been suppressed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245"> 245</span>
military despotism, and the pride which animates the strenuous
virtues of a rising commonwealth was extinct. Levity
pervaded the aimless crowd who lived only for the diversion
of the hour. Nature had been interrogated repeatedly with
an invariably negative result; her secret, if she possessed one,
seemed to be impenetrable and destined to remain for ever
unknown. No discovery in science had opened up the vista
of a path which led through inexhaustible fields of knowledge.
The psychical unrest longed for new ideals and was
willing to be appeased by the slightest semblance of a revelation.
Religion-making became a craft which was followed
by more than one practitioner in all the chief cities of the
Empire. A host of charlatans arose and made many victims by
pretending to theurgic powers.<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> Agitated by vague impulses
the social units drifted with indeterminable currents, for more
than a century before the heterogeneous elements which
were in commotion showed a tendency to group themselves
under any concrete forms. At length the appearances of a
settlement became visible, and three distinct forms emerged
successively from the previously existing chaos, each of
which claimed to have sounded the abysmal depths and to
have brought to the surface the inestimable balm which was
to salve the bruised souls of humanity. But they beheld
each other with horror and contempt, and a contest was
initiated between them on the theatre of the Empire for the
spiritual dominion of mankind.</p>

<p>I. In the year 28 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, the fifteenth of the reign of Tiberius,
Pontius Pilate was governor of Judaea, the subordinate officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246"> 246</span>
of Aelius Lamia, the Imperial legate of Syria.<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> At that point
of time a man, previously unknown among the Jews, assumed
the rôle of a public teacher of religion and ethics and devoted
himself to an itinerant mission throughout the cities and districts
of Palestine. He seemed to be about thirty years old
and it was soon realized that he was a certain Jesus who had
hitherto worked as a carpenter, his father’s trade, in his
native village of Nazareth. He preached a reformation of
manners among the people generally, and rebuked with a
penetrating bitterness the pride and hypocrisy of the chief
men of his own race. At the outset of his career he summoned
to his assistance twelve men of the same humble
rank as himself and enjoined them to follow his example.
He did not confine himself to hortatory discourses, but
proved on numerous occasions that he had the gift of working
miracles. At his command the sick were healed and
even the dead returned to life. Those who were possessed
with devils he immediately released from their baleful thraldom.<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>
The laws of nature appeared to be subject to his will
and were reversed whenever he thought fit to exert his power
over them. Finally he declared himself to be the Messiah
or Christ, a more than mortal being whom the Jews expected
to rescue them from their political abasement and raise
them to a position of national supremacy. Israel as a body
rejected his claims with scorn and derision; his ministry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247"> 247</span>
peace afforded no prospect of the rehabilitation they aspired
to.<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> He met them in the temple at Jerusalem and they demanded
of him a sign that he was an emissary sent from
heaven. In reply he assailed them with vituperation and
hurried from the precincts. Amongst his own following he
explained himself; his design had been entirely misconceived;
he was the son of Jehovah and his kingdom was not of this
world. He had been sent to reconcile his own nation to his
father, the ruler of the universe, whom they had offended by
their moral laxity and corruption. He would shortly depart
from the earth, but he would soon return with all the powers
of heaven to judge the inhabitants of this lower sphere.
Then the just would be received into a state of bliss without
end, whilst the wicked should be consigned to everlasting
torment. He persisted in his didactic work, which tended to
make the chief priests and elders odious in the eyes of the
people, until they determined to compass his destruction.
Ultimately he was seized and brought before the Roman
governor as a mover of sedition, but Pilate was unconcerned
and wished to release him. His accusers insisted, he yielded
and, after suffering every indignity, Jesus was crucified between
two thieves on mount Calvary during the Paschal
festival of <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 29, under the consulship of the two Gemini.<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>
But his disciples had been forewarned by their master that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248"> 248</span>
his death in the guise of a malefactor was preordained as an
atonement to effect the redemption of the world from sin.
Had it been otherwise legions of angels would descend to
discomfort his impious antagonists. At the same time he
predicted that he would rise from the dead on the third day
after the burial of his body. This promise was fulfilled, his
sepulchre was found empty, and Jesus appeared again to his
disciples. He discoursed with them for forty days, constituted
them apostles to preach his Gospel not only to the
Jews, but also to the Gentiles, and in their presence ascended
into the heavens until the clouds received him out of their
sight.</p>

<p>Such was the astounding relation elicited with some difficulty
from a sect of new religionists called Christians, who,
as early as the reign of Nero, were sufficiently numerous at
Rome to have incurred the hatred of the populace through
their austere disposition and their stern abjuration of the
national gods.<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> In the year 64 the city was devastated by
an appalling conflagration of which the insensate emperor
was himself accused, but he shifted the odium to the already
discredited recusants, and condemned many of them to perish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249"> 249</span>
in the flames by a peculiarly atrocious method.<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> Nevertheless
the Christians maintained their ground and thirty years
later were regarded with hostility by the tyrant Domitian as
a body of proselytizing Jews in the capital.<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> At the dawn of
the second century the younger Pliny found them so numerous
in his province of Bithynia as almost to have subverted
the established religion. In great concern he wrote to the
Emperor Trajan questioning whether he should proceed to
extremities in his efforts to suppress them. This epistle is
extant, and through it some details were first made public as
to their tenets and mode of worship. Before daybreak on a
certain day they met and recited an address to Christ as to
a god; bound themselves by oath to commit no crime against
society, and partook together of a common meal. The cultured
Roman, imbued with literature and philosophy, estimated
the Christian belief as a depraved and extravagant
superstition, the eradication of which was dictated by state
policy, but his master counselled him to disregard it unless
popular animosity should in particular instances compel him
to drag its devotees from their obscurity.<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> The Christian
missionaries pursued their labours unremittingly and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250"> 250</span>
especially active among the proletariat, from whom during
the first centuries their converts were almost exclusively
drawn.<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> Throughout the length and breadth of the Empire
they persistently undermined the existing order of things by
teaching doctrines which were at variance with the received
conception of Roman citizenship. Not only did they revile
the pagan deities, whom they classed as demons instead of
gods, and shun their festivals,<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> but they evinced an utter
aversion for military service.<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> The polytheists were incensed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251"> 251</span>
at the pretensions of a deity who would not share the theocracy,
but claimed to oust all other divinities from their
seats and occupy the celestial throne alone,<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> whilst statesmen
became alarmed at the prospect of political defection, and
began to second the vulgar prejudice by systematic efforts
at exterminating the spreading sect. The benignant Marcus
Aurelius was induced to believe that the Christians were a
danger to the state and he issued a decree (<i>c.</i> 177) that they
should be sought out and put to death unless willing to
abandon their faith.<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> This was the first decided persecution,
but, although many perished, it proved ineffective, as no
means available were strong enough to extinguish the flames
of fanaticism. On the contrary, those who stood firm before
the tribunals and were allowed to escape with their lives
ranked afterwards as “Confessors,” a title more glorious in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252"> 252</span>
the eyes of their fellows than any temporal dignity; whilst
constancy to the death became the essential qualification of
Martyrs or witnesses to the truth, Saints who were admitted
forthwith among the heavenly host as mediators between
God and man.<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> As soon as the repressive measures were
relaxed all the weaker brethren, who had abjured in the face
of danger, prayed for readmission to the conventicles, and
were usually received after the infliction of a term of penance.
Once and again during the next century and a half widespread
persecution was had recourse to by Decius and by Diocletian,
but the Christians throve and prospered in the intervals
despite of fitful and local hostility.<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> The memorable battle
of the Milvian bridge in 312 proved to be a turning-point
in the history of Rome and of Christianity; and the state
religion of the ancient world was involved in the fall of the
dissolute Maxentius. The victorious Constantine, as sole
Emperor of the West, immediately concerted a measure with
his colleague of the East, Licinius, for the establishment
of religious toleration throughout their dominions.<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> Thenceforward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253"> 253</span>
Christianity was free to expand in obedience to the
charge she had received at her origin and to apply herself to
the task of supplanting every other belief.</p>

<p>The acceptance of all religions is pressed by an appeal to
the supernatural sub-structure on which they profess to be
based; and this claim is substantiated by the presentment of
some miraculous circumstances from which they are asserted
to have derived their birth. Evidential obscurity has always
been the soul of such pretensions; and the truth of the most
improbable occurrences has been resolutely maintained because
assured witnesses could not be produced in order to
prove a negative. But the time for historical discussion or
sifting of evidence in relation to such matters has long gone
by; and in the twentieth century the philosopher is enabled
without examination to dismiss with a smile the mere suggestion
that such events have occurred.<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> That any narrative,
which in its essential statements consists largely of the
marvellous, should be rejected as false in its entirety has
almost risen to the dignity of a canon of historical criticism.
The principle, however, has often been unduly strained in
its application; and no judicious investigator would refuse
to allow that a slender thread of fact may sometimes be
extricated from a mass of incredible legend. The awe-inspiring
life of Jesus emanates from authors of unascertainable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254"> 254</span>
date and repute. No neutral scribe, no adverse critic,
has furnished us with any personal impressions of his career
bearing the intrinsic marks of truth and simplicity. Nor can
it be affirmed that any character fairly discernible on the
stage of history ever knew an apostle. The Twelve who are
credited with having disseminated the faith of the Gospel
from east to west lie buried in a more than prehistoric
obscurity, the writings ascribed to them doubted, denied, or
clearly disproved.<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> It can scarcely be a matter of surprise,
therefore, if some serious scholars of modern times have
committed themselves to an absolute denial that the nominal
founder of Christianity has had any real existence.<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a> Yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255"> 255</span>
cause of mysticism was well served by the impenetrable
cloud which hung over the mundane activity of Jesus. No
common inquiry enabled the diligent adversaries of Christianity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256"> 256</span>
to strip the veil from the idealized figure, and expose
its features to the gaze of vulgar observation. The philosophic
critic was reduced to mere expressions of incredulity;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257"> 257</span>
and the despair of historians became the firmest pillar of
belief in the church.<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258"> 258</span></p>


<p>II. In an idle hour Plato applied himself to shadowing
forth a theological doctrine which should account for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259"> 259</span>
origin and guidance of the objective universe.<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> A supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260"> 260</span>
god, the One or the Good,<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> at a certain moment conceived
a creative design and fashioned the material world out of
pre-existing elements.<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> This task completed, he created intellect
and soul; and by combining the two together produced
living intelligence.<a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> He was now provided with all the requisite
ingredients for peopling the world he had made; and his
next step was to form a primal race of spiritual beings or
daemons whom he endowed with immortality. From these
by generation issued the whole progeny of gods worshipped
by the Greeks, for whom their pedigrees and actions were
recorded by Orpheus, Homer, and Hesiod. Among the
divine existences were also to be reckoned the stars. At
this stage the creative work of the One came to an end.
He addressed the daemons and said: “You have observed
my method of procedure when engaged in moulding yourselves.
Follow my example and set about the production of
mortal natures to inhabit the air, the water, and the earth.”
They obeyed his behests, and the whole animal kingdom
was the result of their labours. But the grosser matter with
which mortal souls are weighed down is the essence of
evil, and the just man will, therefore, desire to escape from
the body in order to be free from its impure passions.<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a>
For the Creator had appointed that each soul should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261"> 261</span>
associated with a particular star, to whose blissful abode it
might return as the reward of a life well spent on earth.
The unrighteous soul, however, must first be chastened by
an ordeal of transmigration through descending grades
of lower animal natures, the least abased being that of a
woman.</p>

<p>This cosmological phantasy of Plato was destined, after
lying dormant for more than five centuries, to breathe a new
spirit into the almost inanimate body of polytheism. The
higher social caste, still adhering languidly to the old belief,
counted among them many elevated minds devoted to the
traditions of the past, who apprehended with dismay the
dissolution of all they prized in the ebbing tide of Paganism.
The effete superstition could only be sustained by some process
of depuration capable of reconciling it with the more
refined perceptions of the age. The required influence was
at hand. From Alexandria, where an international fusion of
philosophies and religions had been in progress almost since
the foundation of the city, a new dispensation proceeded
before the middle of the third century. In that capital, the
Greek was penetrated by the spirit of Oriental mysticism,
and the Jew was fascinated by the intellectual ascendancy
of the schools of Athens. The ancient rivalry of sects had
almost died out, and a later generation of inquirers adopted
freely whatever they could assimilate from various systems
of philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> After passing tentatively through several
stages from the first years of our era, a theological doctrine
under the name of Platonism was elaborated by the Egyptian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262"> 262</span>
Plotinus,<a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> with sufficient completeness to be presented to
the devout polytheist as a rule of life. In general conception,
the new faith did not differ essentially from the scheme advanced
by the founder of the Academy, but, with its deficiencies
supplied from exotic sources, it was propounded
solemnly as a theosophy which revealed the whole purport
of human existence. As a practical religion, this revival,
Neoplatonism by name, enjoined a purity of life which should
free the soul from defilement by contact with the world, and
allow it to coalesce with the divine potential whence it had
emanated.<a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> The crowning allurement of the system was that
this blissful conjunction might be attained by the fervid
votary even during life. Those who had subjugated all their
natural, and, therefore, evil passions, might rise by contemplation
to an ecstatic union with the Deity, the transcendant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263"> 263</span>
One; or, to express it irreverently in modern language, might
acquire the faculty of passing into a hypnotic trance.<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> As
soon as Plotinus had perfected his invention, he proceeded
to Rome (<i>c.</i> 244), with the view of professing his doctrine
to the mystically inclined on the most extended theatre
in the Empire. Here his success was very considerable,
and he gained numerous adherents, especially as he
conceded that all forms of Pagan worship availed as a real
approach to the Deity and enshrined germs of truth derived
from some primitive revelation. He became influential
at Court and was about to organize a Utopian community
on the lines of Plato’s ideal republic under the auspices
of Gallienus when the fall of that Emperor frustrated his
design.</p>

<p>Plotinus died in 270, leaving many disciples to continue
the work of his school, the foremost of whom was Porphyry,
known as a keen assailant of Christianity.<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> To him succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264"> 264</span>
the Syrian, Iamblichus, a contemporary of Constantine, who
gave the final form to Neoplatonism and adapted it for widest
acceptance. The religion of Plotinus was an ineffable creed
which avowedly excluded vulgar participation, and was
addressed only to cultured aspirants;<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> but a descent was
made by his successors who, with the object of amplifying
their influence, embraced gradually all the crass superstitions
of the multitude. A mystical signification was read into the
sacred books of the Greeks, as the poems of Orpheus,
Homer, and Hesiod may appropriately be termed, by an
allegorical interpretation of every phrase or incident in the
text. All trivial circumstances or immoral pictures were thus
disclosed to be fraught with spiritual or ethical meaning for
the pious reader.<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> The endless procession of invisible beings
with which Eastern fancy had peopled space, angels, demons,
archons, and demigods, were accepted by the latter school
and associated to the theocracy as mediators who could be
summoned and suborned to human purposes by magic rites,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265"> 265</span>
incantations, and sacrifices.<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> By the time this stage had been
reached, Neoplatonism appeared to be fully equipped for
satisfying the occult proclivities of all classes, and asserting
its right to become the prevailing religion of the state.</p>

<p>III. The most distinctive and irrepressible theological
principle which entered Western civilization from the East,
was the dualistic conception of nature inherent in the old
Babylonian religions. The seers of that ancient people could
not resolve the problem as to the providential government
of the world, without postulating a perpetual strife between
two opposed powers, who were engaged in determining the
course of events. The spectacle of suffering humanity enforced
the belief that a potent spirit of evil shared the control
of the existing order of things to an equal extent with the
benign Deity from whom all blessings flowed. The eastern
provinces of the Empire became saturated with these views,
and the prime mover in diffusing them was said to be that
Simon Magus who, although he makes but a brief and insignificant
appearance in Gospel history, occupies a very
considerable space in extra-biblical literature.<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> Under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266"> 266</span>
name of Gnostics, recipients of a special enlightenment or
<i>gnosis</i>, his reputed progeny swarmed about the early Christian
Church, whose presence seemed to rouse them into vitality;
for, in the doctrine of redemption by Jesus, they found, as
they imagined, the key to much that was unexplained in
their own system.<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> Diversity in the apprehension of detail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267"> 267</span>
was an innate characteristic of the Gnostic brood; whence it
followed that they became apparent in small sects only,
computed at some scores, and, though numerous, never
attained the weight of union as a religious body. Gradually
they were dissolved by the preponderance of the Catholic
Church, which absorbed their members and proscribed their
peculiar tenets.<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

<p>There was, however, one form of dualism which arose
beyond the borders of the Empire, and, from its centre in
Persia, spread with great rapidity eastwards to the frontiers
of China, and westwards as far as the Atlantic ocean. This
international faith, for such it became in less than a century,
was called Manichaeism from its founder Mani, of whom
little certain is known; but he was probably a native of
Ecbatana, the Median capital.<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> As the prophet of a new
dispensation, Mani belongs to the second class of makers of
religion, that is, he did not claim to be himself a god, but
only an apostle commissioned by the Deity. His life extended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268"> 268</span>
to upwards of sixty years, and he was countenanced
by more than one of the Sassanian kings. At length, however,
he fell a victim to the jealousy of the Magi, the exponents
of the established belief of Zarathushtra, at whose
instigation he was crucified and flayed by Bahram I. In the
system of Mani the fundamental conception is the antithesis
of light and darkness, by which the opposition between good
and evil is vividly denoted; and the present world originates
in the accident of a war breaking out between the respective
powers. Satan, the Prince of Darkness, discovers by chance
the kingdom of light, the existence of which was previously
unknown to him, and, with his army of demons, makes an
incursion into it. The God of Light, sustained by his pure
spirits, engages and defeats him, but during the campaign a
commingling has occurred of elements of the two realms.
The contest now resolves into the efforts of the Deity to regain,
and of Satan to retain, the portions of light which were
lost in the darkness. The first step is the formation by the
former of this world, but the latter creates man as a secure
receptacle for the light he had acquired. Hence this creature
is animated by two souls, an evil one as well as a soul of
light; and Satan enslaves him by exciting his bad passions.<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a>
The process of restoring the light goes on continually, and
the sun and moon are great reservoirs into which it is poured
by the active agents of the superior Deity. The human race
is placed in possession of the clue to paradise by having this
gnosis imparted to it. A rigid asceticism must be practised
according to prescribed rules. There were, however, two
ranks of Manichaeans, the Elect and the Auditors. The
earnest votaries joined the first, and on them celibacy and a
vegetarian diet were imposed. Membership of the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269"> 269</span>
was adapted to the masses, from whom only moderate abstinence
was required. They ministered religiously to the
Elect, whom they thus enlisted as redeemers on their behalf,
so that with the addition of a term of purgatory after death,
they also became fitted for paradise. Mani utilized some of
the ideas of Christianity in order to connect his religion
practically with mankind, but his transferences are rather
imitations than acceptances of anything really Christian.
Thus he acknowledged a Jesus Christ, who abides in the
son, as the “primal man” or first-born of the Deity.<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> He
had visited the earth as a prophet, and from him Mani had
received his apostolic mission, whence he usurped the title
of the Paraclete, whose advent was promised in the Gospels.
He also instructed twelve disciples to preach his doctrine.
The success and prevalence of Manichaeism was at one time
very great, for it arose as the revivifying force of more than
one aspect of dualism in the East and West. It fostered the
time-honoured traditions of the inhabitants of the Euphrates
valley, and drew to itself the disintegrating coteries of
Gnostics within the Roman Empire. A Manichaean popedom
was established, which had its seat for several centuries
in Babylon. As early as 287 Diocletian denounced the propagation
of the religion as a capital offence, on the grounds
that the “execrable customs and cruel laws” of the Persians
might thereby gain a footing among his “mild and peaceful”
subjects.<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270"> 270</span></p>

<p>From the foregoing summary it will be seen that in the
first years of the fourth century polytheism, as resuscitated
by Neoplatonism, held the field against its rivals with the
support and approval of the government. We cannot attempt
here to fathom the motives, so prolific as a literary theme,
which induced Constantine first to favour Christianity, then
to embrace it for himself and his family, and finally to raise
it into the safe position of being the only religion recognized
by the state. In the blank outlook of the times some definite
belief was a necessity, and, whether from policy or conviction,
he steered his course in the direction where the tide
seemed to set most strongly. Pure Neoplatonism was congenial
only to persons of a meditative temperament; to the
sober-minded it was artificial and unconvincing. Its loftier
heights were inaccessible to the masses, and in its later
development it threatened to make common cause with the
jugglers and charlatans who risked a conflict with the law.<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a>
Manichaeism had only begun to rear its head, and at the
best contained much that was fantastic and incomprehensible
to a non-Semitic people.<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> Christianity was simple, positive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271"> 271</span>
socialistic, a leveller of class distinctions, for the slave as well
as for the free man, and absolutely intolerant of every other
religion. Its emissaries believed implicitly in their mission,
and worked incessantly among the lower stratum of the
population, to whom they delivered the message of their
Gospel in clear and precise terms. By their vehement assertion
there was no escape from, and no alternative to the
acceptance of their creed. The Day of Judgment was at
hand; at any moment Jesus might return to inaugurate a
golden age of one thousand years upon the earth; and all
those who had been regenerated by baptism would participate
in His glory.<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> The primitive church was communistic in
principle, and exceptional solicitude was shown in the administration
of charity to its indigent members. Liberality
in this sense was doubtless the means of winning over many
converts, for its bounty was not withheld from the poor on
account of any difference in religion.<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272"> 272</span></p>

<p>The Christian Church from its inception gradually unfolded
itself as an anarchical association, consisting of
affiliated branches scattered throughout the Empire. At first
all members possessed equal rank, and the status of each
one as a presbyter or propagandist was limited only by his
natural capacity for the work. Enthusiasm prevailed in the
secret assemblies, and the excitable, whether male or female,
relieved themselves by impassioned utterances which were accepted
by the listeners as prophetic inspiration.<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> Subsequent
history relates the development of a hierarchy with the consequent
formation of two parties in the Church, clergy and
laity, and the ultimate suppression of all spiritual assumption
by the latter.<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> Rites and ceremonies of increasing complexity
were instituted, rules of discipline were elaborated, and
proselytes were no longer admitted hastily to the congregations,
but were previously relegated for a course of instruction
to the class of <i>catechumens</i> or probationers. About the end
of the second century Christianity assumed some importance
in the eyes of the educated and wealthy,<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> so that its doctrines
began to be scrutinized in the spirit of Greek philosophy.
A catechetical school was founded at Alexandria (<i>c.</i> 170) for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273"> 273</span>
the training of converts of higher mental capacity; and
learned teachers, notably Clement and Origen, essayed to
prove that the new religion could be substantiated theologically
by reference to Plato and Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> At the same time
the Church began to discard the policy of stealthiness under
which it had grown up, and to indulge the expansive vigour
which pervaded its constitution. Soon the conventicles ceased
to meet under the cloak of secrecy; and by a few decades
public edifices were erected with an architectural ostentation
and a treasure of ornaments rubric which roused the indignation
of those who frequented the Pagan temples in the
vicinity.<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a> From that moment the encroaching temper of
Christianity and its uncompromising antagonism to polytheism
became manifest to the government, and zealous
officials prepared themselves for a determined effort to overthrow
the upstart power which was undermining the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274"> 274</span>
order of society.<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> The futile struggle of Paganism against
Christianity was terminated by Theodosius the Great, who
promulgated edicts both in the East and in the West for the
abolition of the pristine religion of the Empire.<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> During
more than half a century previously the battle between the
two faiths had been open and violent; and the mild Christians
of earlier times often appeared in the light of ruthless fanatics
more conspicuously than had their heathen adversaries in
the heat of a legalized persecution.<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> The Church triumphant
now entered on its career of quasi-political predominance;
wealth and honours were showered on those who attained
to its highest offices; and the precepts of the poor carpenter,
whose constant theme was humility, were inculcated by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275"> 275</span>
succession of haughty prelates who equalled the magnificence
and exceeded the arrogance of kings.<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a></p>

<p>From the day of its birth almost to the present hour the
Church has been agitated by internal dissensions generated
by the efforts of reason to understand and to define those
inscrutable mysteries, to a belief in which every supernatural
religion must owe its existence. The primitive religion of
the ancients was a natural growth, accepted insensibly during
a state of savagery and maintained politically long after it
had been repudiated by philosophy, but Christianity was
offered to a world already advanced in civilization, and had
to pass through a process of intellectual digestion before it
could take its place as an unassailable national belief. The
Church, before it stands clearly revealed in the light of
history, had been inspired with the conception of a Trinity
by a contemplation of the Platonic philosophy; and the
problem as to how this doctrine could be expounded as not
inconsistent with monotheism occasioned the first of those
great councils called Oecumenical. It met in 325 at Nicaea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276"> 276</span>
of Bithynia, and there formulated the Nicene creed, which
branded as heretics the presbyter Arius and his supporters
for asserting that the Word, the Son, the man Jesus, had not
eternally existed as of one substance with the Father, but had
been created out of nothing at some date of an inconceivably
remote past. Under the emperors who succeeded Constantine,
however, the Arians returned to power in the East, and
for long oppressed their opponents, the Catholics, until they
were finally reduced to impotence by the orthodox Theodosius
I.<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> But centuries were yet to elapse before the Church
could desist from weaving those subtleties of dogma as to the
inexpressible nature of the Godhead, in the study of which
later theologians discover an exercise for their memory rather
than for their understanding.<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> Numerous other councils were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277"> 277</span>
convened before the opening of the sixth century, but of
these only three were allowed to rank as Oecumenical, that
of Constantinople in 381, that of Ephesus in 431, and that
of Chalcedon in 451. The first of these did little more than
to confirm the decisions of Nicaea, but it won from Theodosius
a tacit permission to proceed to extremities against
Paganism.<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> The second anathematized the heresy of Nestorius,
Patriarch of the Eastern capital, who wished to deprive
the Virgin Mary of the title of Theotokos, or Mother of God.
The bishops who assembled at the Asiatic suburb of Chalcedon,
under the supervision of the Emperor Marcian, were
less successful in producing concord in the Church than
those who composed any of the previous councils; and their
resolutions were debated for long afterwards by dissentient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278"> 278</span>
ecclesiastics throughout the East. On this occasion the
orthodox party delivered their last word as the mystic junction
of the divine and human in the Incarnate Christ, and
repudiated for ever the error of the Monophysites that the
Saviour was animated only by a celestial essence.<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> This was
the first instance in which the new Rome triumphed over her
great rival in the East, Alexandria, which had previously
trampled on her Patriarchs, Chrysostom, Nestorius, Flavian;
as the doctrine of the one nature was peculiarly dear to the
Egyptian Church. But the spiritual peace of the Asiatic and
African provinces had been too rudely disturbed for an immediate
settlement to ensue; and more than thirty years
later the Emperor Zeno was forced to issue a <i>Henoticon</i>, or
Act of Union, in which he sought to induce unanimity among
the prelates of his dominions by effacing the harsher expressions
of the Chalcedonian canons.<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> The measure, however,
was ineffectual; the conflict of doctrine could not be quelled;
and even Anastasius was branded as a heretic by the Byzantines
for not adopting a hostile attitude towards the Monophysites.<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a>
The state of religious parties under that Emperor
may be summarized briefly as follows: Europe was firmly
attached to the Council of Chalcedon, Egypt was bitterly
opposed to it, whilst in Asia its adversaries and adherents
were almost equally divided. Of Arians there were not a few,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279"> 279</span>
but they were everywhere severely repressed. Nevertheless,
in the capital itself a handsome church was reserved for those
addicted to that heresy, St. Mocius in the Exokionion. But
this was an indulgence conceded exclusively to the Gothic
soldiery, all bigoted Arians, with whose faith no emperor ever
dared to tamper.<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> At the same time polytheism appeared to
be extinct; the Pagan temples were everywhere evacuated,
and for the most part purposely ruined.<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> After the murder of
Hypatia the Neoplatonists deserted Alexandria and betook
themselves to Athens, where they were disregarded as a
merely philosophical association without the privilege of
public worship.<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> Manichaeans were numerous within the
Empire, but could only exist in secret as a proscribed sect
subject to severe penalties, confiscation, loss of civil rights,
and relegation to the mines, if convicted.<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> Relics of minor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280"> 280</span>
denominations, more or less obscure and impotent, need not
be more particularly alluded to in this place.</p>

<p>Nothing in this age accelerated the social descent towards
barbarism so much as the illusion that bliss in a future state
was most positively assured to those Christians who denied
themselves every natural gratification whilst on earth. By the
end of the fourth century the passion for the mortification of
the flesh had risen to such a height that almost one half of
the population of the Empire, male and female, had abandoned
civilized life and devoted themselves to celibacy and
ascetic practices.<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> By choice, and even by legal prescription,<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281"> 281</span>
they sought desert places and vast solitudes to pass their
lives in sordid discomfort, at one time grazing like wild
beasts, at another immured in noisome cells too narrow to
admit of any restful position of the body or limbs.<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> Some
joined the class of stylites, or pillar saints, who lived in the
air at a considerable altitude from the ground on the bare
top of a slender column.<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> Such were the anchorites or hermits,
who arose first in order of time and claimed for their
founder an illiterate though well-born youth of Alexandria,<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282"> 282</span>
Anthony, the subject of familiar legends. A little later, however,
Pachomius,<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> also an Egyptian, instituted the coenobites,
or gregarious fraternity of ascetics, whose assemblage of cells,
called a <i>laura</i>, was generally disposed in a circle around their
common chapel and refectory. The extensive waste lands of
Egypt greatly favoured the development of monachism; and
within half a century the isle of Tabenna in the Nile, the
Nitrian mountain, and the wilderness of Sketis, became
densely populated with these fanatic recluses.<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> From Egypt
the mania for leading a monastic life spread in all directions,
and religious houses, on the initiative of Basil, began to invade
the towns and suburban districts.<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> One of the most remarkable
of these foundations was the monastery of Studius,
erected at Constantinople (in 460) for the <i>Acoemeti</i>, or
sleepless monks, whose devotional vigils were ceaseless both
night and day.<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> After the promotion of Christianity to be the
state religion, one emperor only, the ordinarily ineffective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283"> 283</span>
Valens, assumed a hostile attitude towards the monks.<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> He
denounced them as slothful renegades from their social duties
and dispatched companies of soldiers to expel them from
their retreats and reclaim them for civil and military life. A
considerable number were massacred for attempting resistance
to the decree; but under the successors of Valens
monachism flourished as before with the Imperial countenance
and the popular regard.<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a></p>

<p>The supersession of dogmatic religions founded on prehistoric
mythologies by the success of modern research,
confers the right of free speculation on contemporary philosophers,
and urges them to construct, from the ample
materials at their command, an intellectual theory of the
universe. In proportion as experimental physics teaches us
to apprehend more profoundly the constitution of matter,
reason advances impulsively from the outposts of knowledge to
suspend itself over the abyss in those dimly-lighted regions
where science and mysticism seem to hold each other by
the hand. The atomic conception of nature, first broached
as a phantasy by the Greeks, derives an actuality from the
growth of chemical and electrical discoveries at the present
day, which goes far to establish it as an immediate, if not
the ultimate, explanation of phenomena. Our mind has thus
been prepared to realize the vision of swarms of atoms in
the possession of limitless space, each one of which is instinct
in the prime degree with all the attributes of life: with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284"> 284</span>
consciousness, will, motion, the bias of habit, and an unquenchable
desire for association and aggregation.<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a> They
become conjoined, numerically and morphologically, in progressive
grades of complexity, originating by one kind of
alliance the chemical elements which constitute the organic
world, and by another the vital elements, which form the
protoplasmic basis of animal and plant life.<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> The organic
kingdom rests upon the inorganic, and preys upon it, evolving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285"> 285</span>
itself throughout endless time into more highly differentiated
forms by its incessant appetite for material acquisition and
sensuous stimulation in its environment.<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a></p>

<p>Whilst the records of ages assiduously collated from every
quarter of the globe exhibit the irrepressible folly of undisciplined
human thought and the immeasurable credulity
of ignorance, the boundless expansion of our intellectual
horizon compels us to reject as irrational, the belief in an
almighty and intelligent Father, who regards with equanimity
the disruption of worlds, but is capable of being delighted
by a choir of fulsome praise emanating from their ephemeral
inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> From the earliest times the infertile efforts to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286"> 286</span>
approach and win the favour of such a being have constituted
the heaviest drag on civilization and progress; and, as man
rises in the sphere of rationality, the highest lesson he can
learn is to discard definitively all such dreams. He must
convince himself that there is nothing divine, nothing supernatural,
no providence but his own, that prayer is futile, piety
impossible; and the sage may postulate that humanity is
God until some higher divinity be discovered. The mythological
terrors of antiquity are effete in the world of to-day,
and any citizen who has learned to live uprightly should be
above all religion, and free from the bondage of every superstition.
By self-reliance and his own exertions alone can
man be led upwards; his advancement depends on the extent
to which he can penetrate the mystery of, and subdue
the forces which surround him; and to preach the dominion
of man over nature is the work of the modern prophet or
apostle.<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> By a retrospect of the past he is justified in cherishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287"> 287</span>
the hope of a brighter future for his descendants; no
obstacle appears in view to bar their journey along the upward
path; the illimitable capacity of protoplasm for physiological
elevation may triumph over the universal cycle of
birth, maturity, and decay; and in humanity as it exists we
may see the progenitors of an infinitely superior, perhaps of
an immortal race, the ultimate expression and end of evolution
and generation.<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288"> 288</span></p>

<p>The student of European civilization cannot fail to wonder
what sociological manifestation would have taken the place
of Christianity had that religion never seen the light, or
failed to win a predominant position in the Graeco-Roman
world. Was the disintegration of the Empire, he must ask,
and the retreat of its inhabitants almost to the threshold of
barbarism a result of the prevalence of the Gospel creed?
or was the new faith merely a fortuitous phenomenon which
became conspicuous on the surface of an uncontrollable
social cataclysm? No decision could be accepted as incontestable
when dealing with such far-reaching questions, but
with the wisdom which follows the event we may recognize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289"> 289</span>
that contingencies not very remote might have altered
materially the course of history. The dissolution of powerful
political organizations was no new feature in the ancient
world; in Egypt, in Asia, dynasties with their dominions
had periodically collapsed, but in Europe the Roman
supremacy was the first to consolidate the principal countries
into a compact and homogeneous state. Civil wars, however,
had been waged on several occasions; princes unfit to
reign had been the cause of serious administrative perturbation.
Did these vicissitudes, we may inquire, herald the
break-up of the Empire, unassailable as it was by any
civilized adversary? Had the national genius and vigour so
declined that armies could not be recruited to repeat the
successes of Marius, of Trajan, of Diocletian, against hordes
of barbarians ill-disciplined and ill-armed? The proposition
cannot be entertained; the individuals were as capable as
ever, but the purview of life had changed. Religious dissension
had engendered personal rancour, neighbour distrusted
neighbour, and the name of Roman no longer denoted a
community with kindred feelings and aspirations. The Persian
and the Teuton beyond the border were not more hostile
to the subjects of the Empire than were they among
themselves when viewed as separate groups of Pagans, of
Manichaeans, of Arians, and of Catholics. This disseverance
was not, however, quite permanent; after a couple of generations
had passed away a partial reunion was effected by the
submission of all classes to Christianity; and strife was
limited to controversies between differing sects of the same
church. But in the process mankind were led to break with
all past traditions; the world became effete in their eyes;
and to be released from it in order to gain admission to the
celestial sphere was preached as the sole object of human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290"> 290</span>
existence. Civilization succumbed to the despotic influence
of religion, a new field of effort was opened to the race of
mortals, and all the genius of the age was exhausted in the
attempt to advance the pseudo-science of theology. That
genius was as brilliant as any which has hitherto been seen
upon the earth. The administrative and literary powers of
a Tertullian, an Origen, a Cyprian, a Eusebius, an Athanasius,
of the Gregories, of Basil, Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostom,
and many others might have raised the Empire
above the level of the most glorious period of the past. It
is scarcely an exaggeration to say that these ecclesiastics
founded a dominion which surpassed that of Rome in its
widest extent; but it was a dominion over men’s minds
which precipitated material progress into a gulf out of which
it was not to rise again for more than a thousand years.
Their success was facilitated by the confirmation of despotism
and the abolition of free institutions under the first Caesars;
but without Christianity there would probably have been no
exacerbation of religious fervour more intense than was involved
in Neoplatonism. That new departure in polytheism
was not likely to have caused a serious drain upon the
energies of the state. Julian, its most impassioned votary,
was not less imbued with the spirit of a conqueror than were
Alexander and Trajan.<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> Neoplatonism, and especially Manichaeism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291"> 291</span>
borrowed Christian elements and might not have
aspired to more than a passive influence but for their rivalry
with that religion. From these considerations we may draw
the inference that only for the Palestinian capture of the
psychical yearnings of the age history might never have had
to record the lapse of social Europe into the slough of
mediaevalism; and the experience of a terrestrial hierarch
who should give laws to kings and incite the masses to rebel
against their political rulers would have been lost to Western
civilization. That the Empire would have subsisted until
modern times is inconceivable; the tendency to disruption
of the vast fabric soon became apparent, and its unity was
only restored by reconquest on several occasions; notably by
Severus, by Constantine, by Theodosius. Under Diocletian
it was virtually transformed into a number of federated
states; and by the sixth or seventh century a somewhat
similar partition might have become definite and permanent.
With the maintenance of sociological institutions at the
original level, barbarism would have been repelled and
civilization would have penetrated more rapidly the forests
of Scythia and Germany. The spirit of scientific inquiry
which was manifest in Strabo, in Pliny, in Ptolemy, in Galen,
might have been fostered and extended; and many a leading
mind, whose vigour was absorbed by the arid waste of
theology, might have taken up the work of Aristotle and
carried his researches into the heart of contemporary science.<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292"> 292</span>
The condition of the proletariat was not elevated by the
diffusion of the Gospel after their wholesale acceptance of it
had been assured by coercion. Whatever ethical purity may
have adorned the lives of the first converts, Christianity as
an established religion was not less of a grovelling superstition
than Paganism in its worst forms. The worship of
martyrs, of saints, the factitious miracles wrought at their
graves, the veneration of their relics and images, were but a
travesty of polytheism under another name without the
saving graces of the old belief.<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> A large section of the community
were encouraged to fritter away their lives in the
sloth of the cloister; and the ecclesiastical murder, disguised
under the charge of heresy, of opponents who dared to think
and speak became a social terror in grim contrast with the
easy tolerance of Pagan times.<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> At length the night of superstition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293"> 293</span>
began to wane and the unexpected advent of a
brighter era was announced by a great social upheaval.
Again the tide of cosmopolitanism began to flow between
the Atlantic and the Euphrates, and a new unification of the
detached fragments of the Roman Empire was brought
about. Amid the turmoil of two centuries of barren Crusades<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a>
the active intercourse of numerous peoples taught Europe
to think and judge; and she began to appraise the harvest
which had been reaped during so long a period of blind devotion
to a creed. The result of the scrutiny was disheartening;
the store of gold was found to have turned to dross;
and, while one type of man struggled to break the chains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294"> 294</span>
which bound them in spiritual subjection, another bent
their minds to discover whether through nature and art they
could not reach some goal worthy of human ambition. The
Renaissance and the Reformation were almost contemporary
movements.<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> From that period to the present, more than
five centuries, the history of the world has been one of continued
advancement. Since Dante composed his great poem
and Copernicus elaborated his theory of the heavens, the
well of literature has not run dry nor has the lamp of science
been extinguished. Yet in all these years while the rising
light has been breaking continuously over the mountain tops
the spacious valleys beneath have lain buried in the gloom
of unenlightened ages. The peace of society has never
ceased to be disturbed by the discord of religious factions;
and the task of a modern statesman is still to reconcile conflicting
prejudices in a world of ignorance and folly.<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a></p>

<small>BIRTH AND FORTUNES OF THE ELDER JUSTIN: THE ORIGINS

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> function of a government is to administer the
affairs of mankind in accordance with the spirit of
the age. Not from the political arena, but from the laboratory
emanates that expansion of knowledge which surely,
though fitfully, changes the aspect and methods of civilization
both in peace and war. An impulse which controls the
passions of millions may originate with some obscure investigator
who reveals a more immediate means to individual
or national advantage; and the executive of government is
called on to create legislative facilities for the utilization of
the new discovery. During the modern period such influences
have been continuous and paramount. In the course of
a single century a transformation of the world has been
achieved by fruitful research, greater than in all previously
recorded time. The Georgian era contrasts less strongly
with the times of Aristotle and Cicero than with the present
day; and the rapid progress of the nineteenth century almost
throws the age of Johnson and Gibbon into the shadow of
mediaevalism.</p>

<p>Far back in the prehistoric past a bridge was thrown across
the chasm which separates savage from civilized life by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296"> 296</span>
discovery of a process for the smelting of metallic ore; and
the birth of all the arts may be dated from the time when
some primitive race passed from the age of stone into that
of bronze or iron. To the ancient world that first step in
science must have appeared also to be the last; and ages
rolled away during which man learned no more than to employ
effectively the materials thus acquired. If the expectation
that diligent research may be rewarded by some signal
increase of knowledge be excluded from the sphere of human
activity, individual aspirations must be restricted to whatever
is social and national; and those desirous of distinction
have no choice but to devote themselves to art or politics.
Within these channels were confined the energies of the
people of antiquity; in some states the leading characteristic
was civic adornment; in others the cultivation of martial
efficiency; to rise to despotic power was the usual ambition
of a democratic statesman; to attain to an imperial
position that of a flourishing state. Wars of aggression were
constantly undertaken, and defensive wars uniformly became
so whenever superiority was manifested. Such conflicts in
the past have had no permanent influence on the advancement
of mankind; and from time to time have been equally
conducive to the spread of civilization or barbarism. During
the classical period the arts and learning of Athens were attendant
on the success of the Grecian or the Roman arms;
in the Middle Ages the Goth, the Hun, the Saracen, and
the Tartar closed in on the Roman Empire and nullified the
work of those enlightened nations. At the present day the
advance of civilization, though independent of conquest, is
often hastened by aggression;<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> and there seems no likelihood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297"> 297</span>
that it will ever again recede from a territory where it
has once been established. At all times scarcity of the
necessaries of life, real or conventional, tends to initiate a
contest; nor is it possible to foresee an age when, in the absence
of a struggle for existence, the world will subside into
a condition of perpetual peace.</p>

<p>In the sixth century, among the Byzantines, the public
mind was still oppressed with a sense of the supreme importance
of religion. That orthodox Christianity must prevail
remained the passion of the day; and in the view of
each dissentient sect their creed alone was orthodox. Hence
government became an instrument of hierarchy, politics
synonymous with sectarianism, and the chief business of the
state was to eradicate heresy. Mediaevalism was created by
this spirit; in the East the Emperor became a pope;<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> in the
West the Pope was to become a sovereign. The conception
of being ruled from the steps of an altar was foreign to the
genius of classical antiquity, and Christianity almost effected
a reversal of the political spirit of the ancient world.</p>

<p>In the midsummer of 518 occurred the death of Anastasius,<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298"> 298</span>
one of the few capable and moderate Emperors whom
the Byzantines produced. Although imbued with a heresy
by his mother,<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> and zealous for its acceptance,<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a> he refrained
from persecution, and declared that he would not shed a
drop of blood to effect the removal of his ecclesiastical opponents.<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a>
All his efforts were conciliatory, and he would
have obliterated disunion in the Church if his influence
could have induced fanaticism to accord in the Henoticon
of Zeno.<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> He dealt impartially with the Demes, but inclined
slightly to one faction, the Green, in formal compliance
with traditional usage in the Circus.<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> He relieved oppressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299"> 299</span>
taxation,<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> restrained extravagance, and, though practising
thrift,<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> responded liberally to every genuine application.<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a>
His administration was much admired by those who were
free from sectarian prejudice;<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> and even the bigoted adherents
of the Chalcedonian synod cannot avoid being eulogistic
when recounting some of his measures.<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a></p>

<p>Within the Byzantine province of Dardania, to the south
of modern Servia, was situated the municipal town of Scupi,<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a>
in a plain almost contained by a mountainous amphitheatre,
consisting of the Scardus chain, and its connections with the
greater ranges of Pindus and Haemus.<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> Among its dependent
villages, lying along the banks of the Axius or Vardar, the
river of the plain, were the hamlets of Bederiana and Tauresium.<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a>
Under Roman rule the language and manners of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300"> 300</span>
Latium became indigenous to this region; and, although the
barbarians in their periodical inroads poured through the
passes of Scardus on the north-west to spread themselves
over Thrace and Macedonia,<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a> the Latinized stock still maintained
its ground in the fifth century.<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> Throughout the
Empire it was a usual practice for sons of the free peasantry
to abandon agricultural penury, and, without a change of
clothing, provided only with a wallet containing a few days
provisions, to betake themselves on foot to the capital, in
the hope of chancing on better fortune.<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a> About the year
470, when Leo the Thracian occupied the throne, a young
herdsman of Bederiana, bearing the classical name of Justin,
resolved on this enterprise, and arrived at Constantinople
with two companions whose lot had been similar to his
own.<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> There they presented themselves for enlistment in the
army, and, as the three youths were distinguished by a fine
physique, they were gladly accepted, and enrolled among
the palace guards.<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> Two of them are lost to our view for
ever afterwards in the obscurity of a private soldier’s life,<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a>
but Justin, though wholly illiterate, entered on a successful
military career. At the end of a score of years he reappears
under Anastasius, with the rank of a general, and intrusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301"> 301</span>
with a subordinate command in the Isaurian war.<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> A decade
later he is again heard of among those who prosecuted the
siege of Amida, which led to its recovery from the Persians;<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a>
and before the death of the Emperor he becomes conspicuous
at head-quarters, with the dignities of a Patrician, a
Senator, and of Commander of the household troops.<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> While
holding this office he was also deputed to a command at
sea, and took an active part in repelling the naval attack of
Vitalian.<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a></p>

<p>During the vicissitudes of his life in the camp, Justin remained
unmarried and childless, but he became the purchaser
of a barbarian captive, named Lupicina, whom he
retained as a concubine, and never afterwards repudiated.<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a>
While, however, he was rising to a position of importance
and affluence, he was not unmindful of those relatives from
whom he had separated at his native place. At Tauresium
dwelt a sister,<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> the wife of one Sabbatius,<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> and the mother
of two children, a son and a daughter.<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> As soon as young
Sabbatius,<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> for the nephew of Justin bore his father’s name,
had arrived at a suitable age, he was invited to the capital by
his uncle, who became his guardian, and had him educated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302"> 302</span>
in a manner befitting a youth of high rank.<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> On the completion
of his studies, it was natural that Sabbatius should
be claimed for military service, wherein his guardian’s influence
was centred, and he was drafted forthwith into the
ranks of the Candidati or bodyguards of the Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>
Finally Justin legally adopted Sabbatius;<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> and in token of
the fact the latter assumed the derivative name of Justinian.<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a></p>

<p>On the death of Anastasius, as at his accession, the Grand
Chamberlain appeared to be master of the situation.<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> But
the chief eunuch of the day, Amantius, was less influential
than his predecessor, Urbicius, who, with the Empress
Ariadne as an ally, had invested the popular silentiary with
the purple; and the means he devised to ensure the acceptance
of his candidate were the actual cause of his rejection.
He decided to bribe the palace guards to proclaim his
favourite, Count Theocritus, and placed a large sum of
money in the hands of Justin for that purpose; but the procedure
only served to render those soldiers conscious of their
power to elect an emperor, and they immediately acclaimed
their own commandant as the fittest occupant of the throne.<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303"> 303</span>
The venerable Justin, for he was now long past three score,
did not decline; the Senate bowed to the nomination of the
guards, and the former herdsman took his place in line with
the successors of Augustus.<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor Justin was a rude soldier, devoid of administrative
capacity except in relation to military affairs,
and so illiterate that he could only append his sign-manual
to a document by passing his pen through the openings in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304"> 304</span>
plate perforated so as to indicate the first four letters of his
name.<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> After his coronation he married Lupicina; and the
populace, while accepting her as his consort, renamed her
Euphemia.<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> On his accession Justin promoted his nephew
to the rank of Patrician<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> and Nobilissimus;<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> and Justinian
became so closely associated with his uncle that he was
generally regarded as the predominant partner in ruling the
state.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> But the Emperor was jealous of his authority, and
when the Senate petitioned that the younger man should be
formally recognized as his colleague, he grasped his robe and
answered, “Be on your guard against any young man having
the right to wear this garment.”<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> Owing to the suddenness
of their elevation both princes were ignorant of the routine
of government, a circumstance which rendered the position
of Proclus, the Quaestor or private adviser of the crown,
peculiarly influential during this reign.<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305"> 305</span></p>

<p>The first act of Justin, who adhered to the orthodox creed,
was to reverse the temporizing religious policy of Anastasius;
and he at once prepared an edict to render the Council of
Chalcedon compulsory in all the churches. Amantius,
Theocritus, and their party saw in this measure an opportunity
of disputing the unforeseen succession, the overthrow
of which they were eager to accomplish. A conspiracy was
hastily organized, and the malcontents assembled in one of
the principal churches, where they entered on a public denunciation
of the new dynasty. The movement, however,
was ill supported, and Justin with military promptness seized
the chiefs of the opposition, executed several, including the
eunuch and his satellite, and banished the others to some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306"> 306</span>
distant part.<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> The edict was then issued and a ruthless persecution
instituted against all recalcitrants throughout the
Asiatic provinces, where ecclesiastics of every grade professing
the monophysite heresy were put to death in great
numbers.<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> At the same time the Emperor recalled those
extremists whom Anastasius had been unable to mollify and
restored them to their former or to similar appointments.<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a>
One danger still remained which might at any moment subvert
the newly erected throne; the powerful Vitalian was at
large, apparently, if not in reality, master of the forces in
Thrace and Illyria. Emissaries were therefore dispatched to
him with an invitation to reside at Constantinople as the
chief military supporter of the government.<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> He accepted
the proposals, stipulating that an assurance of good faith
should previously be given with religious formalities. The
parties met in the church of St. Euphemia, at Chalcedon,<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>
and there Justin, Justinian, and Vitalian pledged themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307"> 307</span>
to each other with solemn oaths while they partook of the
Christian sacraments.<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> The rebel general was, however, too
weighty a personage to subside into the position of a tame
subordinate, and his masterful presence threatened to nullify
the authority of the Emperor and his nephew.<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> His ascendancy
was endured for more than a twelvemonth, and the
consulship of 520 was conceded to him. But while he celebrated
the games in the Hippodrome popular enthusiasm in
his favour rose to a dangerous height.<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> The Court became
alarmed, and a hasty resolution was arrived at to do away
with him. In the interval of the display he repaired to the
palace with two of his lieutenants to be entertained at a
collation, and on entering the banqueting hall they were
attacked by a company of Justinian’s satellites,<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> and Vitalian
fell pierced with a multitude of wounds.<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> Shortly afterwards
Justinian succeeded to his place and was created a Master
of Soldiers, with the virtual rank of commander-in-chief of
the Imperial forces.<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> The next year he was raised to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308"> 308</span>
consulship<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> and, in order to consolidate his popularity, he
determined to signalize the occasion by those lavish festivities
which were recorded from time to time among the wonders
of the age. But times had changed since the Roman public
might be edified or disgraced by those spectacles in which
human and animal combatants fought to the death, in mimic
land and sea warfare or hunting encounters, to the number
of many thousands; and the chronicler, in referring to a
half-hundred of lions and pards, evolutions of mail-clad
horses, and an increased largess of scattered coin, in addition
to the usual races, bear-baiting, and theatrical shows, thinks
he indicates sufficiently how far the Consul of the day surpassed
the ordinary expectations of the Byzantine populace.<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a>
Having finally won over the capital by these gratifications,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309"> 309</span>
Justinian in his military capacity departed on a tour for the
inspection of garrisons and fortresses throughout the East.<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a>
During this period he made the palace of Hormisdas his
official residence.<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a></p>

<p>The reign of Justin was uneventful politically, the age of
the Autocrator and his incapacity for state affairs precluding
the initiation of any reforms of importance; whilst, although
the foreign relations of the Empire were often in a state of
tension, no considerable hostilities were undertaken.<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> At
home official activity was chiefly engrossed with the planning
of police precautions for the repression of sedition. During
three or four years all the chief cities were agitated by the
turbulence of the Blue faction, which sought to suppress
their rivals of the Green by stoning, assassination, and
wrecking of their dwellings. At length, in 523, the rioters
were subdued by the appointment of special Praefects, whose
severity of character did not shrink from making the culprits
pay the extreme penalty of the law.<a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> With its neighbours of
the East and West the Empire might have existed at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310"> 310</span>
period on terms of perfect amity but for the disturbing influence
of religion. Incensed at Justin’s oppressive treatment
of the Arians, Theodoric, the Gothic king, declared that he
would exterminate the Catholics in Italy<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> if freedom of
belief were not granted to his co-religionists; and he compelled
Pope John I to lead an embassy to Constantinople
with the object of pleading the cause of those heretics at the
Byzantine court. John, the first of his line to visit New Rome,
was received with enthusiasm by the orthodox Emperor;<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a>
but, if the head of the Western Church urged his appeal with
sincerity, Justin at least proved obdurate, and no concession
to the Arians could be extorted from his bigotry.
The Pope returned to Ravenna, the regal seat of the barbarian
king, to expiate his abortive mission by being incarcerated
for the last few months of his life; and the death of
Theodoric shortly afterwards, before he had time to execute
his threats, saved Italy from becoming the scene of brutal
reprisals.<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a></p>

<p>The interspace between the Caspian Sea and the Euxine,
the modern Transcaucasia, was inhabited by semi-savage
races, over whom Rome and Persia preferred almost equal
claims to suzerainty. A perpetual source of friction between
the two powers in this region arose from the necessity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311"> 311</span>
guarding the Caspian Gates,<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> now the Pass of Darial,<a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> a
practicable gorge through the Caucasus, often traversed by
the Scythian hordes when carrying their devastations to the
south. Alexander is said to have blocked the entry with an
iron barrier,<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> and subsequently the pass was kept by the
Romans until the Sassanian dynasty became predominant
in those parts. The utility to both nations, however, of maintaining
the defence, caused the Persians, after the collapse
of Julian’s expedition, to demand that the Romans should
share the expense.<a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> Theodosius I bought off the claims, but
by the time of Anastasius a Hunnish king, in friendly league
with that emperor, had obtained possession of the forts.<a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>
On his death they passed to the Persians, with the consent
of Anastasius, who engaged vaguely to contribute annually.<a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a>
Justin tried to evade this payment, but the Persian monarch
declined to be put off, and, as often as the Emperor fell into
arrears, proceeded to recover the amount by distraint.<a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> His
chosen bailiff, whenever he put in an execution, was a ferocious
sheik of the Saracens, named Alamundar,<a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> who raided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312"> 312</span>
Syria up to the walls of Antioch, massacring the population
indiscriminately, and holding captives of substance against
their being replevied by the Romans.<a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> On one occasion he
burst into the city of Emesa, and finding there four hundred
virgins congregated in a church, he sacrificed them all on
the same day to Al Uzzâ, the Arabian Venus.<a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a></p>

<p>In two states of the Caucasian region, both under kingly
rule, Christianity had gained a footing about the time of
Constantine.<a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> Lazica, previously Colchis, the subject of
heroic legends, and now Mingrelia, occupied the coast of the
Black Sea north and south of the river Phasis. On its eastern
border, watered by the Cyrus, lay Iberia, at present known
as Georgia.<a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> In 522 the young king of the Lazi, alarmed lest
the Persian religion should be forced on him, fled to Constantinople,
and prayed for Christian baptism under the
immediate countenance of the Emperor. Justin assented,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313"> 313</span>
and not only sustained him at the sacred font, but afterwards
united him to a Roman wife, the daughter of one of the
patricians of his court. Before his departure Tzathus was
formally invested with ornaments and robes of state, expressly
designed to denote the closeness of his relationship
to Justin and to Rome.<a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> A letter of remonstrance against
surreptitiously tampering with the allegiance of Persian
subjects soon resulted from these proceedings; but Justin
denied their political significance, and dwelt with fanatical
insistence on the exigences of the faith, and the urgency of
resisting heathen error.<a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> The throne of Persia was still occupied
by Cavades,<a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> and that monarch now began to think
seriously of going to war with Rome. On reviewing his resources
he decided to enlist the Hunnish tribes, who dwelt
beyond the Caucasus, as allies against the Empire. One of
the most powerful chiefs agreed to his proposals, and met
him by prearrangement with a large following of his nation,
but during the conference messengers arrived who protested
that a short time previously the Hun had been induced by
a large subsidy to pledge his support to the Byzantines.
“We are at peace,” said Justin, “and should not allow ourselves
to be duped by these dogs.” In reply to an amicable
inquiry the barbarian boasted shamelessly of the circumstance,
whereupon Cavades, convinced of his treachery, at
once ordered him to be cut down by his guards. Forthwith
a night attack was secretly planned against his forces, who,
without becoming aware of the author of the calamity, were
dispersed and slain to the number of many thousands.<a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314"> 314</span>
More friendly counsels now began to prevail with the Persian,
as it occurred to him that he might compose his differences
with the Emperor to his own advantage. He was extremely
anxious to secure the succession to his favourite son
Chosroes,<a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> to the exclusion of his two elder brothers. There
was reason to fear, however, that on his decease, by the intervention
of the Court or the populace, one of the senior
princes might be raised to the throne. Cavades, therefore,
proposed to Justin that he should adopt Chosroes, considering
that no party would have the temerity to dispute
the tiara with a ward of the Empire. Justin and Justinian
were elated at the prospect of exercising a controlling influence
in Persian affairs, but the Quaestor Proclus quickly
intervened, and by specious arguments, led them to see the
matter in a totally different light. The adoption of the
Sassanian prince, he urged with heat, would convey to him a
title to inherit the crown of the Empire, Justinian might be
ousted from the succession, and Justin would live in dread
of being the last of the Roman emperors.<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> An evasive
course was resolved on, and a commission was dispatched
to meet the Persian delegates in the vicinity of Nisibis.
Chosroes himself advanced to the Tigris in the expectation
of being escorted to Constantinople by the Roman envoys.
The representatives of the two nations met without cordiality,
and the Persians, contrary to their instructions, began
by taunting the Byzantines with having usurped their rights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315"> 315</span>
in Lazica. The Romans then announced that the Emperor
could not adopt a foreigner with legal formalities, but only
by an act of arms, such as was customary among barbarians.
The suggestion was taken as a deliberate insult by the
Persians; the colloquy came to an end abruptly, and
Chosroes returned to his father, vowing vengeance against
the Romans.<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a></p>

<p>It was now evident that war at no distant date could
scarcely be averted, but a further embroilment with respect
to religion provoked overt hostilities, which rendered a positive
conflict inevitable. Having experienced that defection
to Rome was a natural sequence of Christianity being promulgated
in his dependencies, Cavades determined to enforce
Magism among the Iberians. But, at the first intimation,
the king of that people made an earnest appeal to Justin,
and prepared to take up arms in defence of his faith. The
Emperor responded by sending two of his generals,<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> provided
with a large sum of money, to levy auxiliaries for the
Iberians, among the Huns who inhabited the northern shores
of the Euxine.<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> Such was the practical overture to a war
with Persia, which was to last for several years, without any
appreciable gain to either side. During the reign of Justin,
however, hostilities were carried on in a desultory manner,
and no battle of any magnitude was fought. Military detachments
were told off to ravage Persian territory to the
north, in the vicinity of the frontier. They were opposed by
similar bands of the enemy, and from time to time indecisive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316"> 316</span>
skirmishes took place. As to Iberia, that country was
abandoned for the time being, the forces raised being insufficient
to withstand the Persian host, and the king with
all the native magnates retreated into Lazica by a narrow
pass, called the Iberian Gates, which was then fortified by
a Byzantine garrison.<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> During these operations the first mention
occurs of some names which became associated later
on with the most notable events in the annals of the age.
An advance into Persarmenia was conducted by two young
officers, specially deputed by Justinian, named Sittas and
Belisarius. After the lapse of a few months (in 527) the
latter was transferred to a more important command at
Daras. There, among the civil members of his staff, he
received the future historian Procopius as his legal adviser
or assessor.<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> About the same time occurred the death
of Justin, whose reign lasted for nine years and a few
weeks.</p>

<p>If the sea of politics remained comparatively unruffled in
Justin’s time, nature made amends for the lack of excitement
by showing herself physically in her most active mode. His
reign opened with the appearance of a remarkable comet,
the most dreaded portent of impending disaster.<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> Nor were
the forebodings belied, as the provinces on both continents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317"> 317</span>
were afflicted progressively with violent earthquakes, intensified
by volcanic phenomena.<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> In Europe, Dyrrachium,
the birthplace of Anastasius, recently adorned by him at
great cost, was overthrown; and Corinth shortly after experienced
a similar fate. In Asia, Anazarbus, the capital of
Cilicia, suffered; the central half of Pompeiopolis sunk into
the earth;<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> and Edessa was ruined by a flood of the river
Scirtus.<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> The withdrawal of large sums from the Imperial
treasury was entailed by the restoration of these cities. This
series of calamities culminated in the almost total destruction
of Antioch, where the seismological disturbances persisted
for more than a year, the eighth of Justin’s reign, and upwards
of a quarter of a million of the inhabitants perished.<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> The
ground was rifted in all directions with great gaps which
ejected flames; the houses caught fire or collapsed with their
occupants into the yawning chasms; and a hill of considerable
size, overhanging the city, was shattered with such violence
that the streets and buildings in that quarter lay buried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318"> 318</span>
beneath a uniform surface formed by the debris.<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> The preliminary
shocks were generally disregarded, and the climax,
which occurred during the dinner hour,<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> was so sudden and
widespread, that the bulk of the population was overwhelmed
before they had a chance to escape. Then only the residue
of the citizens made a rush for the open country, carrying
with them whatever valuables they could seize on in their
hasty flight. As soon, however, as they had arrived at a safe
distance, they found themselves beset by bands of rustics,
who had gathered together from every side in order to
plunder the fugitives. Conspicuous among the despoilers
was a certain Thomas, a man with the rank of a silentiary,
and wealthy enough to keep a private guard. Posting himself
daily in a convenient position, he directed his retainers in
the operation of stripping systematically all who came in
their way. It is satisfactory to learn from the contemporary
historian that all these wretches were soon overtaken by a
miserable death, as the penalty of their inhumanity; but as
we are assured that, without legal intervention, their retribution
emanated from an indignant providence, which had impelled,
or, at least, lain dormant during the catastrophe, we
must conclude that the Nemesis was desiderated rather
than real. The assertion, however, need not be questioned
that the said Thomas died suddenly, to the great joy of the
survivors, on the fourth day of his nefarious enterprise.
Great consolation was also derived from the preternatural
appearance of a cross in the clouds; and all burst into tears
and supplications at this signal proof of the compassion felt
for them by a beneficent Deity. In two or three weeks after
the crisis, nature assumed her wonted quiescence, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319"> 319</span>
deserted city began to be re-peopled by the returning inhabitants.
The work of restoration at once commenced; and
it is recorded that many persons were then rescued by being
dug out of the ruins, under which they had been buried;
among them numbers of women, who in the meantime had
passed safely through the pangs of childbirth.<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a> As soon as
the news of the downfall of Antioch was carried to Constantinople,
the capital was thrown into a state of consternation,
and all public festivities for the season of Whitsuntide, which
was at hand, were renounced. The Emperor, discarding all
regal pomp, debased himself in sackcloth and ashes,<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> and
led a suppliant procession of the Senate, wearing mourning
garments, to the church of St. John at the Hebdomon.
Commissioners were immediately dispatched with ample
funds for reparation, and the ruined city again became visible
on the face of the earth with a rapidity which, in the words
of a writer of the period, gave the impression that it had reappeared
suddenly out of the infernal regions.<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> But the
earthquakes continued and ultimately, as a safeguard against
further visitations of the kind, Antioch was demised to the
special care of the Deity by being renamed Theopolis, or
the City of God.<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a></p>

<p>The desultory war with Persia was maintained all the time
under the chief command of Licelarius, a Thracian. But that
general, while pushing hostilities over the border into the
vicinity of Nisibis, managed so unskilfully that his whole
forces were seized with a panic and fled back to Roman territory
without ever having sighted an enemy. As an immediate
result Licelarius was disgraced and Belisarius promoted to
fill his place. The youth, as he must be called, fulfilled the
expectations he inspired and thenceforward entered on that
career of achievement which was to render him the military
hero of his age.</p>

<p>On the 1st of April, 527, Justin formally associated his
nephew to the throne, with the rank of Augustus. He lived
exactly four months afterwards,<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> and on the 1st of August in
the same year the sole reign of Justinian began.<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a></p>

<small>PRE-IMPERIAL CAREER OF THEODORA: THE CONSORT OF
JUSTINIAN</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> influence of women in antiquity varied extremely
according to circumstances of time and place. During
the mythical age they are celebrated as the heroines of many
a legend; and in the epics of Homer the free woman seems
to live on terms of equality with her male relations.<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> Down
to the historical period the same consideration was continued
to them at Sparta, where the mental and physical integrity
of the females was cultivated as essential to the designed
superiority of the race;<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> but among the Athenians we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322"> 322</span>
the women of the community ignored as factors in the state
to such an extent, that they rank little higher than domesticated
animals.<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> In neither of these states, however, were
they ever invested with any political office; and their power
could only be felt indirectly by the executive as the result
of their activity as wives and mothers in the family circle.<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a>
But outside Greece, in those wider territories more or less
permeated by Hellenes, women sometimes attained to a full
share of government, inherited or assumed a sovereignty on
the death of their husbands, commanded armies, and even
appeared in martial attire at the head of their troops. Two
Ionian princesses, both of whom bore the name of Artemisia,
reigned in Caria: the elder distinguished herself at sea as
an ally of Xerxes in the naval battle of Salamis (480 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>);<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a>
her successor erected the magnificent monument at Halicarnassus
in memory of her husband Mausolus, hence called
the Mausoleum, which was admired as one of the seven
wonders of the world.<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> Cynane, a daughter of Philip of
Macedon, led an expedition into Illyria, and is said to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323"> 323</span>
killed the queen of that country, in an engagement which
ensued, with her own hand.<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> This lady had applied herself
vigorously to military exercises, and similarly trained up her
daughter Eurydice in the school of arms. As the wife of the
imbecile Arrhidaeus, one of the successors of Alexander,
Eurydice advanced into Asia to meet Olympias, the mother
of that monarch, in a contest which was to decide the fate
of Macedonia. While the young queen, as we are told, displayed
herself with all the attributes of a female warrior, the
dowager chose to accompany her forces with a train of
attendants, who seemed rather to be acting their part in a
Bacchanalian procession.<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> This war, however, proved ultimately
fatal to all three women, who were merely moved as
puppets by the firmer hands of Alexander’s generals in their
rivalry for shares at the dissolution of his empire.<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a> After
the partition of the extensive dominions of Alexander among
his numerous heirs, the number of Grecian women who enjoyed,
or were allied to, sovereign power, was proportionately
increased; and the names of many princesses of varied distinction
in that age have been recorded historically, and
even perpetuated popularly to the present day by towns
designated in their honour, and spread over the three continents.<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a>
While some of these ladies won an unusual share
of marital respect and affection, not only by the graces of
their person, but by their capacity for taking part in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324"> 324</span>
councils of state,<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> there were not a few who signalized themselves
by a cruelty or criminality hardly exceeded by the
male tyrants of that semi-lawless and contentious epoch.
Two Egyptian princesses, sisters named Cleopatra, were ambitious
of occupying the thrones of Egypt and Syria, respectively,
to the exclusion of their own sons. The Syrian
queen, having murdered one of her sons, was obliged to
accept his brother as a colleague, but being unable to nullify
his authority, resolved to make away with him also. On his
return from military drill one day, she presented him with a
poisoned cup, which, however, he declined to empty, having
had an intimation of her design, and bade her swallow the
draught herself. She refused, while denying her guilt, but
he insisted that in no other way could she clear herself, and
she thus fell a victim to her intended treachery.<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> Her sister,
who reigned in Egypt, under almost similar circumstances
was not more fortunate; for, having expelled one of her
sons and committed various cruelties, she raised another to
a partnership in the kingdom. Finding still that her ascendancy
could not be maintained, she planned to assassinate
him, but, being forestalled, perished herself in the attempt.<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a>
Precocious in guilt, but, perhaps, more excusable, was the
Cyrenean princess Berenice, who caused her intended husband
to be murdered in the arms of her own mother, as the
penalty of his having slighted her for this adulterous intercourse.<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a>
Her name has been preserved to us in the nomenclature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325"> 325</span>
of science, and through an astronomical compliment
a cluster of stars is still distinguished as the Coma Berenices.<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>
From these few examples the reader may derive
some notion of the social relations of the ruling families in
that extended Greek realm which came into being as the
result of the conquests of Alexander. One by one the separate
autonomies succumbed to the force of the Latin arms,
and before the beginning of the Christian era all of them
which lay to the west of the Euphrates had become merged
in the provincial system of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>When we turn our attention to the Roman Republic, we
find that the females, although in law subjected absolutely to
the will of their male relatives,<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> were virtually as influential
in the state as were the women at Sparta. From Cloelia<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326"> 326</span>
Portia<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> the maidens and matrons of that community displayed
the spirit and resolution which we should assume to
be characteristic of the wives and sisters of the men who
made themselves gradually the masters of the earth. Nor
were they backward in applying themselves to intellectual
pursuits when the rusticity of the Republic began to be
dissipated by the infiltration of Hellenic culture; and by
their assiduous studies in philosophy, geometry, literature,
and music, they kept pace determinedly with the mental
development of the sterner sex.<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> With the establishment of
the Empire, a greatly enhanced authority became the permanent
endowment of a limited class. It followed naturally
that the female connections of the emperors and their chief
ministers could aspire to participate in the despotic government,
but the throne itself always remained debarred to
women, and to the last days of the Empire the Romans
never acquiesced in a female reign. When Agrippina, presuming
on her power over a son whom her intrigues had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327"> 327</span>
raised to the throne, pressed forward amid general amazement
to preside as of equal authority with him at a reception
of ambassadors, the philosopher Seneca hastily impelled
the young Emperor to arrest his mother with a respectful
greeting, and thus, in the words of Tacitus, “under the
semblance of filial devotion the impending disgrace was
obviated.”<a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> Yet, in several instances, as the guardian of an
immature heir to the crown, or as the associate of an incapable
husband or brother, a woman was able to retain for a
considerable time all the attributes of monarchy. The Syrian
Soaemias, the equal in profligacy of her son Elagabalus,
assumed the reigns of government, and took her seat in the
Senate, which then beheld for the first time a female assisting
at its deliberations.<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> Her career speedily terminated in
disaster,<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a> but during the break-up of the Western Empire,
two centuries later, no opposition was offered to the predominance
of her sex by a dejected people. The Empress
Placidia Galla, after enduring many misfortunes, exercised
a regency scarcely distinguishable from absolutism for more
than a decade, in the name of her son Valentinian III.<a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328"> 328</span>
the East the rule of Pulcheria, as the adviser of her brother
Theodosius II, and afterwards of her nominal husband
Marcian, extended almost to half a century.<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> The importance
of an Augusta in disposing of the crown on the decease
of her husband has been indicated in the description of the
elevation of Anastasius;<a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> and the official who records the
election of Justin, ascribes the turbulence of the populace
on that occasion to the absence of control by a princess of
that rank.<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> But the power of a dowager empress was most
signally exemplified in the case of Verina, widow of Leo I,
who, in her dissatisfaction with the policy of her son-in-law
Zeno, succeeded in provoking a revolution, placed the chief
of her party on the throne for more than a twelvemonth, and
continued to involve the Empire in bloodshed for a series
of years.<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> Below the Imperial dignity the feminine element
was perpetually active and widely exerted, especially throughout
the provinces. The wives of legates, of proconsuls or
governors, accompanied their husbands on their missions to
distant parts, and were often responsible, both in peace and
war, for the complexion assumed by the local administration.<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a>
They displayed themselves ostentatiously in public,
addressed themselves authoritatively to the army, and instigated
measures of finance, to such an extent that they
were sometimes regarded as the moving spirit in whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329"> 329</span>
was transacted.<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> Agrippina shared the hardships of Germanicus
in his campaign against the Germans, opposed
herself to the disorder of the troops when retreating through
fear of the enemy, preserved the bridge over the Rhine,
which in their panic they were about to demolish, and, combining
the duties of a general with those of the intendant
of an ambulance, restored confidence to the legions.<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> Yet
Germanicus, in his Asiatic command, fell a victim to the
machinations of Plancina, the wife of a colleague; and
Agrippina strove ineffectively to withstand the malignant
arts of another woman.<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> In some instances oppression of
the provincials was clearly traceable to female arrogance
and intrigue; and at length it was seriously proposed in the
Senate that no official should be accompanied by his consort,
when deputed to the government of a province. The
motion was hotly debated, but was ultimately lost through
the vehemency of opposition.<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a></p>

<p>Nothing in antiquity is more remarkable than the diversity
of sentiment as to prostitution among the Greeks. Considering
the deification of amorous passion and fecundity expressed
by polytheism in the cult of Aphrodite, and the
ethics of social order which instilled a reverence for chastity,
the popular mind continually wavered as to whether the
<i>hetaira</i> or courtesan should be contemned as an outcast, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330"> 330</span>
adored as the priestess of a goddess. Among the Semites
who dwelt along the Oriental borders of the Grecian dominions
an act of prostitution at the temple of the goddess of
concupiscence was enjoined on every woman at least once in
her life as a religious rite;<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a> but the nicer ethical discrimination
of the Greeks debarred this custom from ever establishing
itself in Hellenic religion. At Corinth, however, one of
the most distinguished art centres of Greece, it obtained a
footing in a modified form; and in that city a thousand
female slaves sacred to Aphrodite were maintained as public
courtesans attached to her temple.<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> At Athens, Solon regarded
the state regulation of prostitution as an essential safeguard
to public morality, whence he constituted a number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331"> 331</span>
brothels under definite rules throughout the town, thus providing,
in his opinion, an outlet for irrepressible passions
which might otherwise be manifested in a more unseemly
manner.<a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> As in all ages there were two grades of females
who led a life of incontinence for the sake of gain; and of
these the higher class, the hetairas, filled a place not devoid
of a certain distinction in most of the Grecian cities. This
class relied not on their personal attractions only, but also
on their mental accomplishments, aspiring to become the
intellectual companions of their lovers by applying themselves
to the study of literature and philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> Hence they
ranked as the best educated women of the community, and
exerted more influence in the state than the usually dull and
secluded housewives. The majority and the most noted of
such courtesans flourished, of course, in Athenian society,
the ascendancy of the women which obtained at Sparta being
altogether adverse to their pretensions. Thus it happened
that the hetairas of Athens were generally regarded as persons
of some consequence; and several writers of the period
thought it no unworthy task to compose their biographies, as
might be done at the present day in the case of eminent
women.<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a> To the connection of Aspasia with Pericles and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332"> 332</span>
position as the leader of Athenian society during his tenure
of power, an important page is devoted in all histories of
Greece; and it appears that even matrons were permitted to
frequent her salon in order to improve themselves mentally
by listening to the elevated discourses held there.<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> Socrates
visited Theodote for the purpose of augmenting his sociological
insight, and Xenophon has included an account of
his debate with her in his memoirs of that father of philosophers.<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a>
Leontium was a conspicuous figure in the garden
of Epicurus, where he convened his disciples; and she
penned a treatise against the Peripatetics, which deserved
the commendation of Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> Scarcely, indeed, can a man
of note in this age, whether potentate, orator, philosopher,
or poet, be found whose name does not occur in anecdote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333"> 333</span>
or more serious record as the associate of some hetaira. It
follows that courtesans should appear not rarely as the
mothers of persons of distinction. Themistocles, the younger
Pericles, Timotheus, and Nicomachus, the son of Aristotle,
are mentioned in this connection;<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> and more than one
sovereign prince is allowed to have been the offspring of
some hetaira, namely, Arrhidaeus, king of Macedonia, alluded
to above, and Philetaerus, the founder of the kingdom of
Pergamus.<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> Many of these hetairas realized wealth, and
some had the faculty of keeping it; nor were they disinclined
to spend it patriotically if an opportunity offered. Lamia
erected a splendid portico at Sicyon;<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> and Phryne proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334"> 334</span>
to rebuild the walls of Thebes, which had been levelled by
Alexander, provided that the fact should be commemorated
by a suitable inscription. The Thebans, however, were too
proud to owe the restoration of their town to such a source.<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a>
As the result of their notoriety and the consideration accorded
to them, some courtesans won the distinction of living
in metal or marble; and it was remarked that, whilst no wife
had been honoured by a public monument, the memory of
hetairas had often been perpetuated by the statuary.<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> The
reasons, however, why courtesans happened to be thus distinguished
were in many instances totally dissimilar: some for
actual merit, others merely through the caprice of passionate
lovers, challenged the popular eye from a pedestal. Leaena
was represented at Athens under the form of a tongueless
lioness, because she preferred to die by the torture rather than
disclose the conspiracy of Harmodius and Aristogeiton
against the tyrants of the day.<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> Even at Sparta the image of
Cottina was a familiar object, standing beside a brazen cow
which she had consecrated to Athena.<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> A sculptured tomb
to Lais was set up at Corinth,<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> and a golden statue of Phryne
was dedicated at Delphi,<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a> to express the admiration of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335"> 335</span>
townsmen for their pre-eminence as venal beauties. A magnificent
cenotaph on the Sacred Way from Athens to Eleusis
surprised a wayfarer into the belief that he was approaching
the tomb of some great general or statesman; it was no
more than the fantasy of Harpalus, an extravagant viceroy
of Alexander’s, constructed in glorification of his deceased
mistress, Pythionice.<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> At Abydos, a temple to Aphrodite,
styled the Prostitute, recorded the patriotic treachery of a
band of loose women, which conduced to the slaughter of an
alien garrison;<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> but when the degradation of Greece was
already far advanced, both Athens and Thebes descended
to flatter Demetrius Poliorcetes by rearing fanes in honour
of his favourite concubine, Lamia.<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a></p>

<p>In the earlier centuries of the Republic the strict censorship
upheld at Rome kept the city purged of dissoluteness;
and prostitution, regularly supervised and licensed,<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> was reduced
to the inevitable minimum; but in proportion as
Hellenic manners permeated the community, the courtesan
established herself on the same footing as in Greece. We
are told that a fortune gained by her harlotry was willed to
Sulla by Nicopolis;<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> and the relations of Flora with the
great Pompey are given in detail by Plutarch. Captivated
by the beauty of the latter, Caecilius Metellus included her
portrait among the adornments of the temple of Castor and
Pollux.<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> Precia, a notorious strumpet, won the devotion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336"> 336</span>
Cethegus, one of the abettors of Sulla, and the heritor of a
large share of his power. At Rome he carried all before him
for some years, whilst he surrendered himself absolutely to
the caprices of his mistress. The provinces were distributed
to her nominees; and the command against Mithridates, in
which Lucullus acquired such extensive territories for the
Republic, was obtained by courting her favour by costly
presents and blandishments.<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a> It is needless to inquire how
far illicit sexual connections were politically operative during
the rule of insensate emperors, for in these times every excess
had its parallel;<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> but it may be noted that the stern and
sordid Vespasian abandoned the patronage of the Empire
to a mistress, into whose lap riches were poured by governors,
generals, and pontiffs, in the form of bribes for securing
coveted appointments.<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> Concurrently with the decline of
the Empire, municipal institutions decayed, especially in the
West, and the sense of public decency became blunted.
When Theodosius visited Rome in 389, he found prostitution
in league with crime and administrative measures more
offensive than the moral laxity they were intended to correct.<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337"> 337</span>
Nor was the balance of public morality redressed until
Europe had passed through mediaevalism, and advanced for
two or three centuries into the modern period.<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a></p>

<p>During the greater part of the reign of Justinian the
fortunes of the Empire were influenced to an unusual extent
by two women, the Empress Theodora and Antonina, the
wife of Belisarius, whom chance had raised from a base
origin to the highest rank in the state. In the early years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338"> 338</span>
of the reign of Anastasius, a man named Acacius filled the
post of bear-keeper to the Green faction. Dying somewhat
unexpectedly, he left his wife and three daughters, Comito,
Theodora, and Anastasia, totally unprovided for. The eldest
child was but seven years old, and the widow immediately
attempted to provide for the future by uniting herself with
the man who was expected to become her late husband’s
successor. Another candidate, however, presented himself,
and by bribing the master of the shows, whose decision was
final, despoiled them of the situation. The family was now
destitute, but the mother resolved on a last effort to enlist
the sympathy of the faction. Binding the heads and hands
of her little girls with wreaths of flowers, according to ancient
custom, she displayed herself with them in the crowded
Hippodrome in the posture of suppliants. These tactics
proved successful, for, although the Greens rejected her
prayer, it happened that the Blue faction were at the moment
in want of a bear-keeper, and they at once preferred the stepfather
to the vacant place. In course of time the daughters
developed into handsome young women, and one by one
were consigned to the theatre, as the sphere most congenial
to the associations in which they had been reared. The
eldest, Comito, was the first to make her appearance, and
she soon became a person of some consequence, if not as
an actress, at least as a hetaira, a career indissolubly linked
with that of a female performer on the stage. At the same
time her younger sister Theodora became a familiar object
to the public. Dressed in a short tunic, such as was worn
by young slaves, she was always to be seen in the wake of
Comito, bearing on her shoulder the folding seat<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339"> 339</span>
which no one of any pretensions could stir abroad. Thrown
into the haunts of vice thus prematurely, she became initiated
objectively, before she attained the age of womanhood,
in all the excesses of lasciviousness.<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a> In her turn, as
soon as she was old enough, she was pushed to the front to
play a part upon the scene, where she soon captivated the
audience by her special gifts. Theodora was short of stature,
of slight physique and pale,<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> whence she became possessed
with the procacity and insistence peculiar to those who fear
to be slighted on account of some physical defect. Her
accomplishments included neither singing nor dancing, but
she proved herself to be a burlesque comédienne of singular
aptitudes. She was quick-witted and full of repartee, and her
air in coming on the stage was at once provocative of mirth.
She excelled particularly in the comic piteousness with which
she resented a mock chastisement delivered, according to a
trick of the day, on her puffed-out cheeks, which seemed to
resound with the severity of the infliction.<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> But she was far
from trusting to merely histrionic art to gain the notoriety
she craved for, and she applied herself sedulously to charm
that considerable section of humanity for whom the salt of
life is indecency. On the scene, or at private reunions, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340"> 340</span>
distinguished herself by her impudicity above any of her
companions. Her ingenuity was inexhaustible in inventing
occasions for the exposition of her nudities, and in sexual
vice she became a mistress of everything fantastic and unnatural.
She dispensed with drapery as far as was permissible
by law, and one of her favourite devices was to
prostrate herself on the stage, with grains of corn distributed
about her person, so that a number of geese, in searching
for their food, might throw her scanty clothing into obscene
disorder.<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a> At orgies of the dissolute she was the life and
soul of the festivities; and she assumed the rôle of instructress
in depravity among her compeers of the theatre.<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a> Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341"> 341</span>
with respect to the latter, she also achieved a reputation for
being quarrelsome and spiteful beyond the usual measure of
her tribe. By her habitual and flagrant excesses, she became
universally known in the capital, and she was shunned by all
worthy citizens to such an extent, that they shrunk from
being sullied by her touch, should they chance to meet her
in the street.<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> If a merchant encountered her in the morning
he was as much scared at the sight as at that of a bird of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342"> 342</span>
ill-omen.<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> Animated by a genius so restless and aspiring, it
is evident that such a woman needed only transference to a
field of higher potential, to become one of the most notable
characters of the age. Such a place had been prepared for
her by fate, and she was destined to renew on the throne
of the Empire the triumphs she had won on the boards of
the theatre.<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343"> 343</span></p>

<p>By a mischance, which she had always practised every
expedient to avert,<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> Theodora became the mother of a son
while at Constantinople. His father christened him John
and, fearing that the repugnance evinced towards the boy
by his mother might endanger his life, he carried him off
into Arabia, the province of his permanent residence.<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a> Soon
afterwards Theodora was induced to quit the capital by a
Tyrian named Hecebolus, who was proceeding to North
Africa to occupy the seat of government in the Pentapolis.
In a short time, however, she alienated this lover by her
petulant temper until, provoked by her insolence, he expelled
her from his establishment without making any provision
for her future. This consummation was assuredly a valuable
lesson by which she did not fail to profit at a later date.
Devoid of resources, she betook herself from Cyrene to
Alexandria, where she attempted to live by prostitution; but
in a strange city, without the entry of a congenial circle, she
discovered that her talents or her attractions were unavailing
to procure a livelihood. From city to city of the East she
proceeded, repeating always the same experience in a state
of incurable distress.<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a> She directed her steps constantly
northwards in her wanderings, keeping her mind fixed on
the capital, to which she longed to return, and at length she
found herself on the southern shores of the Euxine, within
the limits of Paphlagonia.<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> In that austere province, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344"> 344</span>
the circus and the theatre were eschewed, and fornication
and adultery were looked on as the most abominable crimes,<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a>
it is possible that she may have been affected by the puritanism
of the inhabitants, certain that she must have felt
chastened by the trials she had undergone. It is probable
also that she remained there for some time in the receipt of
hospitality, whilst being exhorted and encouraged to live a
life of continence. Ultimately, however, she found means to
regain Constantinople, where she arrived in a sober frame of
mind and with the resolution not to relapse into her former
habits. She sought out a humble tenement in a portico near
the district of Hormisdas,<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a> where she resigned herself to earn a modest living
by feminine industry.<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> A veil of obscurity hangs over the circumstances
which preceded the social elevation of Theodora,
which can only be partly dissipated by surmise. It appears
that after the accession of Justin she was discovered by Justinian
sitting demurely at her spinning-wheel, and that he was
fascinated by her at once with a force which he was unable
to resist.<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a> It is allowed that she was not devoid of beauty,<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a>
but if she captivated him by that quality, it was one which
she possessed in common with a thousand others of her class.
Rather must we conclude that she won her dominion over
him by her distinction of mind and character, by her wit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345"> 345</span>
vivacity, insight, and social address.<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a> He was now verging
on his fortieth year, and, as we shall recognize more fully
hereafter, must always have been of a staid disposition, as
free as possible from the wildness of youth. How far he was
acquainted with her past is altogether unknown; if her
travels had extended to a few years her former intimates
might now for the most part be scattered, her person might
be half forgotten, and her meretricious enormities but faintly
remembered. Her scenic extravagances may never have
been witnessed by Justinian, but it is certain that before
long her former mode of life was at least partially revealed
to him. Their intercourse soon ripened into familiarity; he
made her his mistress, but without concealment, and with
the fixed intention of marrying her; and as the first step
towards that end he raised her to the rank of a patrician.<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a>
Theodora was now removed from her sordid surroundings
and housed in a style suitable to her enhanced fortunes.<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a>
At the same time her sisters, Comito and Anastasia, were
rescued from their degrading vocation and maintained in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346"> 346</span>
manner befitting their semi-royal relationship.<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> Her influence
with Justinian became unbounded, and, as the favourite of
the virtual master of the Empire, she was courted by all
aspirants to the emoluments of state.<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> Her age was now
more mature; she had been taught discretion and self-restraint
in the school of adversity, and she was wise enough
for the future not to hazard her ascendancy by yielding intemperately
to her passions. Her physical mould was not
that of a sensual woman, her amazing immorality resulted
merely from an inordinate desire to outrun all competition
in the career on which she had been launched, and we may
believe that, after every incentive to sexual excess had been
removed from her path, she found no difficulty in leading a
life of the strictest chastity. Her energies were now directed
into other channels; she did not deny herself the indulgence
of using the exceptional power with which she was invested
to gratify her ambition to the full; she accumulated wealth
by every means possible to an official of the highest authority,
and she seldom allowed the machinery of government to
escape altogether from her control.</p>

<p>Two obstacles stood in the way of Justinian when he proposed
to make Theodora his wife. In the first place he was
confronted by the old law of Constantine which aimed at
preserving the aristocratic families of the Empire free from
any taint in their blood. It was enacted thereby that no
woman of vicious life, actress or courtesan, or even of lowly
birth, could become the legal spouse of a man who had
attained to the rank of Clarissimus or Senator, the third<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347"> 347</span>
grade of nobility.<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> To abrogate this statute was therefore a
necessity before he could carry out his design, but he easily
prevailed on Justin to give the Imperial sanction to a Constitution
which recites at length the expediency of granting
to such women, who have repented and abjured their errors,
an equality of civil privileges with their unblemished sisters.<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a>
A further impediment arose from the opposition of the
Empress Euphemia, who withstood the marriage with an
obstinacy which neither argument nor entreaty could overcome.<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a>
Although her relationship to Justin had until recently
been abased, the quondam slave had never deviated from
the path of virtue and had imbibed all the prejudices of
the strictest matron against women who made a traffic of
their persons. A critical delay thus became inevitable, but
Theodora passed through it triumphantly, and in 524, by
the death of Euphemia, Justinian was freed from all restraint.
Their nuptials were then celebrated with official acquiescence
and without even popular protest. The Church, the Senate,
and the Army at once accepted the former actress as their
mistress, and the populace, who had contemplated her extravagances
on the theatre, now implored her protection with
outstretched hands.<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a> The crown with the title of Augusta<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348"> 348</span>
was bestowed on her by Justinian at the time of his own
coronation;<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a> and she acquired an authority in the Empire
almost superior to that of her husband. After her elevation
Theodora became a zealous churchwoman, and extended
her protection far and wide to ecclesiastics and monks who
had fallen into distress or disrepute through being worsted
in the theological feuds which were characteristic of the age.
But she was always bitterly hostile to those who opposed
her particular religious views or political plans, and proceeded
to the last extremity to subject them to her will.<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a></p>

<p>Antonina sprang from the same coterie as Theodora, but
her birth was more disreputable. Her father was a charioteer
of the Circus at Thessalonica, and her mother a stage-strumpet.<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a>
The two women were not, however, companions, perhaps
not even acquainted, as the wife of Belisarius was
almost a score of years senior to the Empress, and she also
exceeded the age of her husband by an even greater amount.
It appears, therefore, that whilst Justinian was probably
twenty years older than Theodora, Belisarius was at least as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349"> 349</span>
much junior to Antonina. The latter was, in fact, the mother
of several illegitimate children before being married, and a
son of hers named Photius, not more than eight or ten years
junior to his stepfather, is an observable figure in the historic
panorama.<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a> We have no details as to the career of Antonina
previous to her becoming involved in the current of political
affairs, nor can we regret the loss of another story of moral
obliquity, but there is evidence to prove that she was a
woman of a totally different stamp from the Empress, one
disposed by natural propensity to debauchery, and at no
time inclined to deny herself the pleasures of incontinency.
At the outset of Justinian’s reign Theodora regarded her
with the greatest aversion, but whether because the character
of Antonina was at variance with her own or that she
loathed the presence of one too well informed as to her own
antecedents cannot now be determined. In the political
vortex they were unavoidably thrown much together, and it
will often be necessary to inquire as to how far the course of
history may have been modified by their respective activities
and temperaments.<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a></p>

<p>P. 20, n. 1. The date of the dialogue Philopatris has been the subject
of much argument, notably in <i>Byzant. Zeitschrift</i>, vols. v and vi, 1896-7.
It has been placed under Carus, Julian, Heraclius, and John Zimisces. The
matter is unintelligible unless at an early period of Christianity, and I
should be inclined to maintain that interpolations in one or two places
by late copyists (see <a href="#Page_256">p. 256</a>) have given it a false semblance of recency.</p>

<p>P. 24, note. John Malala was unknown to Ducange (not having been
published till 1691), and hence has been neglected to a great extent by
later writers on Byzantine antiquities. He is the earliest authority for
much of what is to be found in the later chronographers. According to
Conybeare the Paschal Chronicle did not copy Malala, but an original
common to both; <i>Byzant. Zeitsch.</i>, 1902.</p>

<p>P. 33. There is no record of the building of the Golden Gate, but
John Malala (p. 360), says that Theodosius II gilded it, whence the
name. Most probably this statement includes the erection of the monument.
I am now satisfied that the Golden Gate had no direct connection
with Theodosius the Great, but was raised by his grandson to commemorate
the overthrow of the usurper John by his generals Aspar and
Ardaburius at Ravenna in 425. This is the “tyrant” alluded to (“post
fata tyranni”), who had supplanted the infant Valentinian III in the
West, afterwards the husband of Eudoxia, daughter of Theodosius II.
The victory caused the greatest excitement at CP., of which Socrates
(vii, 23) gives a striking account. They were all sitting in the Hippodrome
when the news arrived, whereupon the Emperor, with the whole
audience, rose up, abandoned the games, marched through the streets
singing enthusiastically, and the rest of the day was spent in the
churches giving utterance to fervid prayers. It is inconceivable that so
tame a couplet could have been composed to celebrate the martial deeds
of Theodosius I. The clash of arms would have been heard in any inscription
designed to record the achievements of an Emperor who won
battles in the field by his own tactics and strategy. But in a generally
quiet reign, with the palace under the rule of the women, any decided
success would be magnified and the weakling Theodosius II would
naturally be associated with the prestige of his grandfather, whose name
he bore. The case is one on all fours with that of the great statue in
Taurus (erected after a minor Persian war), so skilfully allocated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362"> 362</span>
Déthier (see <a href="#Page_72">p. 72</a>) and the boastful inscription on it (Gk. Anthol. Plan.,
iv, 65). The inscription on the Golden Gate was not sculptured, but
was composed of metal letters fastened to the stone by rivets. Many of
these holes can still be located on the decayed surface. These were first
observed by Strzygowski in 1893, and by joining them judiciously the
form of the letters originally attached could be made out. The lines ran
across the top of the gate, the first verse of the couplet being on the left
side, the second on the right. See the monograph by S. on the Golden
Gate, Jahrb. d. Kaiser. Deutsche Archæol. Instit., 1893, viii, 1. But the
origin of the old Golden Gate in the Constantinian wall remains unsolved;
for surmises see Van Millingen.</p>

<p>P. 31. It is highly improbable that the wall of Theodosius ever ran
through to the Golden Horn, as, in order to do so, it would have had
to cut the parish or region of Blachernae in two. It must have pulled
up therefore at the previously existing wall which surrounded that part;
see the Notitia, reg. xiv. Hence there must always have been a projecting
portion of the fortifications at this end.</p>

<p>P. 37. Van Millingen decides to identify the palace of Bucoleon with
that of Hormisdas, as hitherto the building on the wall has been popularly
named. This identification now seems to me quite tenable. Both the
Anon. and Codinus (pp. 45, 87) mention, in somewhat different terms,
the locality of H., and connect it with Port Julian, evidently to the
west of the existing ruin. I am satisfied that the latter is really the
Bucoleon built by Theodosius II, and that the Hormisdas, which must
have been altogether reconstructed by Justinian (Procop., Aedific., i,
10), has quite disappeared. Theodosius could not by any sort of implication
be said to have built a house of Hormisdas, who was dead long
before he was born. Later this palace (Hormisdas) was diverted to
ecclesiastical purposes, became, in fact, a sort of Church House, where
meetings were held, and also a hostelry for members of the priesthood
when visiting the capital; see pp. 669, <i>sqq.</i> In the latter connection it is
often mentioned by John of Ephesus in the work already referred to (p.
345, n. 2).</p>

<p>P. 74. The identification of the <i>Bin bir derek</i> with the cistern of
Philoxenus is a mere surmise—a monogram on the columns is said to
stand for  Εὖγε φιλόξενε! The researches of Forscheimer (and Strzygowski)
give a more likely elucidation which, with the <i>Yeri Baian Seraï</i>, a
much larger cistern still full of water, will be considered later on. See
p. 539 and cf. Lethaby and S., p. 248.</p>

<p>Pp. 78, 319. There were three localities at CP. which might conceivably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363"> 363</span>
have been called Hebdomon by the inhabitants: 1. The seventh
of the fourteen parishes of the city as described in the Notitia; 2. The
camping ground near Blachernae of the seventh regiment of Gothic
mercenaries; 3. A kind of Field of Mars for reviewing the troops situated
seven miles from the Milion on the shore of the Propontis. When
processions to the Hebdomon are mentioned, it is always the last place
which is meant, and there the church of St. John was founded. I do
not know whether there is any literary reference to either of the first
two localities under that name, but much confusion has been occasioned
by the contradictory views of various writers, especially Gyllius and
Ducange; see Mordtmann, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 29.</p>

<p>P. 100. The actual sums which it appears that scholars accept as obligatory
on three praetors to spend annually for the public shows are
respectively £150,000, £120,000, and £90,000, in all £360,000! Under
these circumstances it was scarcely worth while for Olympiodorus to
mention such a trifle as the 1,200 lb. of gold (£48,000), expended by
Probus in his praetorship, unless it was to show how beggarly he was
in comparison with his predecessors in office, the least of whom had to
disburse under legal compulsion nearly double that amount. It is
strange that none of Gibbon’s editors has noticed that his “ridiculous
four or five pounds” is in reality £57 5<i>s.</i>, at his own estimate of the
value of the <i>follis</i> (.548<i>d.</i>), viz., 1∕ 2025 of the silver <i>follis</i> or purse, which
he makes equal to £6; iii, p. 293 (Bury). I have read somewhere that
Sir Isaac Newton could not work the simple rules of arithmetic.</p>

<p>Pp. 252, 274. The evidence for Galerius’s edict of toleration and
Constantine’s Edict of Milan (313) is the same, viz., Lactantius and
Eusebius. There is no good reason to doubt the latter. The attitude of
Galerius towards Christianity was mere toleration after failure to suppress;
Constantine’s that of favour and adoption. Every one knew that
Galerius would spring again if he got the chance. If C. took up
Christianity as one of his religions <i>c.</i> 312, he would naturally, after his
victory, issue a manifesto to define his personal policy and inclinations.
Too much stress is often laid on the light doubts of recent investigators.</p>

<p>P. 294, n. 2. Since this section on religion was written, two movements
on the lines indicated have come to the surface, one a petition by
university teachers for more freedom in dealing with the mythological
texts in relation to students, the other a similar petition by ministers of
the establishment, for the same freedom, with respect to the public.
Both failed, but doubtless the tide of rationalism will rise again and
again until the desired emancipation be achieved. These are symptoms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364"> 364</span>
of a readjustment of popular religious beliefs at no distant date, perhaps
within a generation or two, a consummation I had not anticipated as
likely to occur for centuries to come. But, as the chick emerges suddenly
from the egg which immediately before was to all appearances physically
unaltered, so sociological revolutions, long brooding beneath the surface,
are sometimes fully achieved in a moment of time.</p>

<p>Pp. 345, 348. Were we without the Anecdotes of Procopius we should
still know practically all that he has revealed about Theodora. 1. That
she was a prostitute, John of Ephesus, Aimoin. 2. That she was in a
very lowly condition before her marriage, Codinus. 3. That she was vindictive
and cruel when on the throne, Liber Pontificalis, Vigilius. All
this evidence is adverted to circumstantially in its proper setting throughout
the work.</p>

country and of the suggestiveness of the remains which lay around them.
But an awakening has now taken place and the modern Greeks are
among the most ardent in the pursuit of archaeological knowledge.
They have even revived the language of Attica for literary purposes, and
it may be said that an Athenian of the age of Pericles could read with
facility the works now issued from the Greek press of Athens or of Constantinople—a
unique example, I should think, in the history of philology.
Through Paspates (Βυζαντινὰ Ανάκτορα, pp. 95, 140), we are

modern works of reference the dates 684, 667 seem to be most generally
accepted. I pass over the legends associated with this foundation—the
divine birth of Byzas; the oracle telling the emigrants to build opposite
the city of the blind; another, which led the Argives (who were also
concerned in the early history of Byzantium) to choose the confluence of
the Cydarus and Barbyses, at the extremity of the Golden Horn, whence
they were directed to the right spot by birds, who flew away with parts
of their sacrifice—inventions or hearsay of later times, when the real
circumstances were forgotten (see Strabo, vii, 6; Hesychius Miles, De
Orig. CP., and others), all authors of comparatively late date. Herodotus
(iv, 144), the nearest to the events (<i>c.</i> 450 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), makes the plain

to old Byzantium, respecting which it is only certainly known that it
stood at the north-east extremity of the promontory (Zosimus, ii, 30;
Codinus, p. 24; with Mordtmann’s Map, etc.). It can scarcely be
doubted that the site of the Hippodrome was outside the original walls,
and thus we have a limit on the land side. It may be assumed that the
so-called first hill formed an acropolis, round which there was an external
wall inclosing the main part of the town (Xenophon, Anabasis,
vii, 1, etc.). Doubtless the citadel covered no great area, and the city
walls were kept close to the water for as long a distance as possible to
limit the extent of investment in a siege.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="label">[41]</a> His reasons for this step can only be surmised. A political motive
is scarcely suggested. A second capital cannot have been required to
maintain what Rome had conquered, and was soon made an excuse for
dissolving the unity of the Empire. His nascent zeal for Christianity,
by which he incurred unpopularity at pagan Rome, has been supposed
to have prejudiced him against the old capital, and moved him to build
another in which the new religion should reign supreme, but these
opinions emanate only from writers actuated more or less by bigotry.
Although he virtually presided at the Council of Nice and accepted

iv, p. 199), Constantine was at one time in the habit of exclaiming: “My
Rome is Sardica.” He was born and bred in the East, and hence all
his tastes would naturally lead him to settle on that side of the Empire.</p>

an impression that in or after 363 (Gesner’s date, formerly accepted)
churches were so few and inconspicuous that the bulk of the population
knew nothing about them. The Notitia, again, half a century
later, reckons only fourteen within the city proper, including Sycae

p. 20, says that the two factions of the circus, each containing eight
thousand men, were employed on the work. Beginning at either
end, they met centrally at a gate hence called “of many men” (Polyandra).
Mordtmann (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 28) wholly rejects this tale, as it does
not fit in with some of his identifications. It would, however, be well
suited to the P. Rhegii, where the existing inscriptions are found. Some
local knowledge must be conceded to an author of the twelfth century,
who probably lived on the spot. Wall-building was a <i>duty</i> of the factions.</p>

built a wall across the isthmus against Xerxes in a short time
(Herodotus, viii, 71, etc.). There was much extemporary wall-building
at Syracuse during the siege by Nicias (Thucydides, vi, 97, etc.). The
wall of Crassus against Spartacus was nearly forty miles long (Plutarch,
Crassus). Except the first, however, these were more or less temporary
structures. Very substantial extempore walls are frequently
mentioned by both Greek and Latin historians as having been erected
during sieges, etc. See especially Caesar (i, 8) and Thucydides (iii, 21,
Siege of Plataea).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_82" href="#FNanchor_82" class="label">[82]</a> The earliest and most reliable source is the Notitia Dignitatis
utriusque Imperii, etc., which dates from the time of Arcadius. To
this work is prefixed a short description of Rome and CP., which
enumerates the chief buildings, the number of streets, etc., in each
division of those cities. Next we have the Aedificia of Procopius,
the matter of which, however, does not come within the scope of the
present chapter. A gap of six centuries now occurs, which can only
be filled by allusions to be found in general and church historians,
patristic literature, etc. We then come to a considerable work, the
Anonymous, edited by A. Banduri (Venice, 1729), a medley of semi-historical
and topographical information, often erroneous, ascribed
to the twelfth century. A second edition of this work, introduced by
the Byzantine fragment of Hesychius of Miletus, passes under the name
of Geo. Codinus, who wrote about 1460. Here we draw the line between
mediaeval and modern authors, and we have next the Topography of
CP., by P. Gyllius, a Frenchman, who wrote on the spot about a
century after the Turkish conquest. His Thracian Bosphorus, which preserves much of the lost Dionysius of Byzantium, is also valuable.
Later still comes the monumental CP. Christiana of Ducange (Paris,
1680), a mine of research, by one of those almost mediaeval scholars,
who spent their lives in a library. Of contemporary treatises, which are
numerous and bulky, I will only mention the following, from which I
have derived most assistance: J. Labarte, Le Palais Impériale de
CP., Paris, 1871; A. G. Paspates, Βυζαντιναὶ Μελέται, CP., 1877,
and Βυζαντινα Ανάκτορα, Athens, 1885; W. Mordtmann, Esquisses
topographiques de CP., Lille, 1891. Among books intended less for
the archaeologist than for popular perusal, the only one worthy of
special mention is Constantinople, Lond., 1895, by E. A. Grosvenor, a
fine work, admirably illustrated, but the author relies too implicitly on
Paspates, and he has emasculated his book for literary purposes by
omitting references to authorities. The book also contains several
absurd mistakes, <i>e.g.</i>, “The careful historian who ... wrote under
the name of Anonymos,” etc., p. 313. To the above must now be added
the important, Byzantine CP., the Walls, by Van Millingen, Lond.,
1899, a sound and critical work. Another beautiful work has also been
recently issued, viz., Beylié, L’Habitation byzantine, Grenoble, 1902.
A wealth of authentic illustrations renders it extremely valuable for the
study of the subject. This chapter was begun in 1896, and in the meantime
scholars have not been idle. As the Bonn Codinus gives inter-textually
all the passages of the anonymous Patria which differ, as well
as an appendix of anonymous archaeological tracts, I shall in future, for
the sake of brevity, refer to the whole as Codinus simply in that edition.</p>

The splendid dome of the Pantheon dates, of course, from Hadrian, but
the invention of the modern cupola may fairly be assigned to the
Byzantines. The conception, however, had to be completed by raising
it still higher on a <i>tour de dome</i>, the first example of which is St. Augustine’s,

was adopted (Grosvenor, <i>loc. cit.</i>). At present the walls appear as a
heterogeneous mass of stone and brick, showing that they have been
repaired hurriedly numbers of times. But little is left of the fifth century
structure. Some parts, better preserved, exhibit alternate courses of
stone and brick, a favourite style of building with the Byzantines, but
not dating further back than the seventh century (Texier and Pullan,

<p><a id="Footnote_103" href="#FNanchor_103" class="label">[103]</a> Those who have a topographical acquaintance with Stamboul are
aware that at about three-quarters of a mile from the Golden Horn the
wall turns abruptly to the west and makes a circuit as if to include a
supplementary area of ground. It is well understood that this part, which
is single for the most part and without a moat, but by compensation on
a still more colossal scale, is the work of later emperors—Heraclius, Leo
Armenius, Manuel Comnenus, and Isaac Angelus (600 to 1200). All
traces of the wall of Theodosius, which ran inside, have disappeared,
according to Paspates, but Mordtmann thinks he can recognize certain
ruined portions (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 11 and Map).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105" class="label">[105]</a> It appears that Anthemius in 413 (Cod. Theod., XV, i, 51) only
raised the great wall, and that in 447, when fifty-seven towers collapsed
(Marcellin. Com., <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 447; Chron. Pasch., 447, 450 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), Cyrus repaired
the damage and added the lesser wall (Theophanes, an. 5937;
Cedrenus, i, p. 598, and the words ἐδείματο τείχεϊ τεῖχος of the inscription).
Cedrenus states virtually that he demolished the wall and replaced
it by three others, alluding perhaps to the moat, but Cedrenus is often
wrong. All seven (or nine) chronographists relate more or less exactly
that Cyrus gained such popularity by his works that the public acclamations
offended the Emperor, who forced the tonsure on him and sent him
to Smyrna as bishop in the hope that the turbulent populace, who had
already killed four of their bishops, would speedily add him to the
number. By his ready wit, however, he diverted their evil designs and
won their respect. Zonaras, xiii, 22, and Nicephorus Cal., xiv, 1, have
an incorrect idea of the wall-building. According to the latter, Anthemius
was the man of speed. Malala mentions Cyrus, but not the wall.</p>

rigorously guarded at that time. Doubtless the city side was adorned,
but no description of the gate as a whole is left to us. The ornaments
are only mentioned incidentally when recording damage done by earthquakes
(in their frequency often the best friends of the modern archaeologist)
and their arrangement can only be guessed at. Most likely they
were of gilded bronze, a common kind of statue among the Byzantines.
See Codinus, <i>passim</i>. The idea that the Golden Gate opened into a
fortress should be abandoned. The conception of the Seven Towers
seems to have originated with the Palaeologi in 1390, but Bajazet ordered
the demolition of the unfinished works (Ducas, 13), and it was left to
the Turkish conqueror to carry out the idea in 1458. See p. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>. I may

prove the existence of a harbour approachable only from the palace,
which probably was then, or afterwards became, the Boukoleon. Van

Mica or talc (<i>lapis specularis</i>) was commonly used at Rome for windows
(Pliny, H. N., xxxvi, 45). Gibbon rather carelessly says that Firmus
(<i>c.</i> 272) had glass windows; they were vitreous squares for wall decoration
(Hist. August., <i>sb.</i> Firmo). Half a century later Lactantius is clear
enough—“fenestras lucente vitro aut speculari lapide obductas” (De
Opif. Dei, 8). Pliny tells us that clear glass was most expensive, and,

cedres dorés jusqu’à hauteur d’homme. Des paons de la Chine, des
faisans et des ibis, volaient en liberté dans les arbres ou s’abattaient sur

We hear nothing of it in connection with Arcadius, Theodosius II, etc.,

Their conceptions differ considerably, the former writer being generally
in close accord with the literary indications. Paspates is too Procrustean
in his methods, and unduly desirous of identifying every recoverable
fragment of masonry. Their works are based almost entirely on the Book
of Ceremonies of Constantine VII, but even if such a manual existed for
the date under consideration the historical reader would soon tire of an
exposition setting forth the order and decoration of a hundred chambers.</p>

intercolumnar spaces were adorned with statues we have no information.
The wealth of such works of art at Constantinople would render it extremely
likely. Cassiodorus says the statues at Rome were as numerous
as the living inhabitants (Var. Ep., xv, 7). We know from existing coins
that the Coliseum was so ornamented (see Maffei, Degl’ Amfitheatri,

Constantine had regained possession of that memorial; Eusebius, Vit.

defacement of this monument was carried out methodically during a
nocturnal incantation under Michael III, <i>c. 835</i>. At the dead of night
“three strong men,” each armed with a sledge-hammer, stood over it
(Ἐν τοῖς εἰς τὸν εὔριπον (see <a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>) τοῦ ἱπποδρομίου χαλκοῖς ἀνδριᾶσιν
ἐλέγετό τις εἶναι ἀνδριὰς τρισὶ διαμορφούμενος κεφαλαῖς) prepared to knock
off the respective heads on the signal being given by an unfrocked abbot.
The hammers fell, two of the heads rolled to the ground, but the third
was only partly severed, the lower jaw, of course, remaining; Theoph.,
Cont., p. 650; Cedrenus, ii, p. 145. On the capture of the city in 1453
the fragment left was demolished by Mahomet II with a stroke of his
battle-axe to prove the strength of his arm on what was reputed to be a
talisman of the Greeks; Thévenot, Voyage au Levant, etc., 1664, i, 17,
“la maschoire d’embas.” So history, as it seems, has given itself the
trouble to account for the mutilation of this antique. I must note, however,
that neither Buondelmonte, Gyllius, Busbecq, Thévenot, nor Spon,
has described the damages it had sustained at the time they are supposed
to have contemplated the relic. See also Grosvenor, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 381,

any authorities.</p>

from); Nero first made a sweeping enactment against the use of
the colour (Suetonius, in Nero, 32; cf. Julius, 43). Women, however,
were generally permitted some latitude and not obliged to banish it altogether

was sometimes exhibited in bulk, and hollow globes have been found
with three chambers in which are contained samples of earth from the
three continents; see Sabatier, Mon. Byzant., Paris, 1862, p. 33. The

on the Empress’s skirt of <i>magi</i> in short tunics and Phrygian caps,
bearing presents. The men’s shoes, or rather slippers, are fitted with
toe and heel pieces only, and are held on by latchets. The ladies’ shoes
are red, and have nearly the modern shape, but are not laced at the
division. Their gowns and shawls are of all colours, and much resemble
diagonal printed calico, but in such cases it is the richness of the fabric
which tells. The materials for illustrating the costume of this period
are very scanty; we have neither the countless sculptures, wall-paintings,

<p><a id="Footnote_430" href="#FNanchor_430" class="label">[430]</a> Cod. Theod., VI, iv, 5, 26, etc. By a law of 384, eight praetors
were appointed to spend between them 3,150 lb. of silver, equal to
about £10,000 at that date, a credible sum; but the common belief that
three annual praetors used to be enjoined to disburse more than a quarter
of a million sterling in games is, I make no doubt, rank nonsense. Large
amounts were, no doubt, expended by some praetors (Maximus, <i>c. 400-420</i>,
<i>for his sons’</i> 4,000 lb. of gold, over £150,000, yet, only half the sum;
Olympiodorus, p. 470), but these were intended to be great historic
occasions, and are recorded as such, bearing doubtless the same relation
to routine celebrations as the late Queen’s Jubilees did to the Lord Mayor’s
shows, on which a few thousands are annually squandered. Maximus
was then bidding for the purple, in which he was afterwards buried.
The question turns on the enigma of the word <i>follis</i>, which in some
positions has never been solved. But Cod. Theod., XII, i, 159, makes
it as clear as daylight that 25,000 <i>folles</i> in <i>ibid.</i>, VI, iv, 5, means just
about fifty guineas of our money (he had also to scatter £125 in silver as
largess), a sum exactly suited to <i>ibid.</i>, VII, xx, 3, by which the same
amount is granted to a superannuated soldier to stock a little farm. The
first law publishes the munificence of the Emperor in presenting the sum
of 600 <i>solidi</i> (£335) to the people of Antioch that they may not run
short of cash for, and so be depressed at the time of, the public games.
And so the colossal sum doubted by Gibbon, accepted by Milman, advocated
by Smith, and asserted by Bury may be dissipated like a puff of
smoke in the wind. The office of <i>praetor ludorum</i> seems to have been
falling into abeyance at this time.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_455" href="#FNanchor_455" class="label">[455]</a> The immorality of the stage is the constant theme of Chrysostom.
The fact that he draws no ethical illustrations from the drama seems to
prove that no plays were exhibited in which virtue and vice were represented
as receiving their due award. Fornication and adultery were the
staple allurements of the stage; Act. Apost. Hom. xlii, 3 (in Migne, ix,
301). From the culminating scene of “The Ass” in the versions both
of Apuleius and of Lucian it would seem that practical acts of fornication
were possible incidents in public performances. It must be remembered,
however, that women did not frequent the Greek or, at least, the
Byzantine theatre. Sathas labours vainly to prove the existence of a
legitimate Byzantine drama; Ἱστορ. δοκ. περὶ τ. θεάτρ. καὶ τ. μουσικ. τ.

in the world until the Middle Ages had long been left behind.
Thus by the Assize of Jerusalem, promulgated by Crusaders in the
twelfth century, a war-horse was valued at three slaves! Tolerance, the
toning-down of fanaticism, doubt as to whether religious beliefs are really
of any validity, appears to be the foster-mother of humane sentiment. A
slave could be trained to any trade, art, or profession, and their price
varied accordingly. Thus common slaves were worth about £12,
eunuchs £30; before ten years of age, half-price. Physicians sold for
£35, and skilled artificers for £40; Cod., VII, vii. The modern reader
will smile at the naïveté of Aristotle when he states that some nations are
intended by Nature for slavery, but, as they do not see it, war must be
made to reduce them to their proper level; Politics, i, 8.</p>

Never break into a guffaw, as you often do, but smile sweetly and seductively.
Do not throw yourself at a man’s head, but behave with tact,
cultivate sincerity, and maintain an amiable reserve. If you are asked to
dinner be careful not to drink too much; do not grab the viands that are
offered to you, but help yourself gracefully with the tips of your fingers.
Masticate your food noiselessly, and avoid grinding your jaws loudly
whilst eating. Sip your wine delicately, and do not gulp down anything
you drink. Above all things do not talk too much, addressing the whole
company, but pay attention chiefly to your own friends. By acting in this
way you will be most likely to excite love and admiration”; adapted

this commerce of the sexes was encouraged by Elagabalus, and again

whether nuptials could be legal unless accompanied at least by an orgiastic
festival. To dispel this misgiving Theodosius II in 428 decreed
that no sort of formal contract was required, but merely fair evidence
that the parties had agreed to enter the connubial state; Cod. Theod.,

be seen even at church by intending suitors; possibly they were kept
closely veiled. On this point see further Puech’s Chrysostom, Paris,
1891, p. 133. An introduction of this kind had always been considered
necessary, as is shown by the equitation of the phallus (Mutinus) imposed
on Roman brides the first night. These old customs were a constant

<p>For the estimation in which paederasty was held in Crete see Strabo, X,
iv, 21; Athenaeus, xi, 20. Old men even wore a robe of “honour” to
indicate that in youth they had been chosen to act the part of a pathic.
The epigram on Julius Caesar is well known—“omnium mulierum vir,
omnium virorum mulier”; Suetonius, in Vit. 52. Anastasius, who seems
to have been somewhat of a purist for his time, abolished a theatrical
spectacle addressed particularly to the paederasts, against which Chrysostom
had vainly launched his declamations; In Psalm xli, 2 (in Migne,
v, 157). “Boys, assuming the dress and manners of women, with a
mincing gait and erotic gestures, ravished the senses of the observers so
that men raged against each other in their impassioned fury. This stain
on our manners you obliterated,” etc.; Procopius, Gaz. Panegyr., 16.
The saint is much warmer and more analytical in his invective.</p>

Byzantine sociology is due to Montfaucon, who, at the end of his edition
of Chrysostom brought together a selection of the most striking passages
he had met with. These excerpts were the germ and foundation of a
larger and more systematized work by P. Mueller, Bishop of Zealand;
De Luxu, Moribus, etc., Aevi Theod., 1794. An article in the Quarterly

by most of the Roman emperors, weighing even one or two lb. Hist.
Aug., Alexander, 39. This imposing coinage appears to have been
used for paying subsidies or tribute to barbarian nations. They were
carried slung over the backs of horses in those leathern bags, which we

shifting quantity, was not very different in these ages to what it is at
present. To give a few examples: bread was about the same price,
common shoes cost 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> a pair; a workman, according to skill,
earned 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> a day; see Dureau de la Malle, Econ. polit. des
Romains, Paris, 1840; also Waddington’s Edict of Diocletian; an
ordinary horse fetched £10 or £12; Cod. Theod., XI, i, 29, etc. On
the Byzantine coinage see Sabatier, Monnaies Byzant., etc., Paris, 1862,
i, p. 25, <i>et seq.</i> An imperfect, but so far the only comprehensive work;
cf. Finlay, Hist. Greece, i, p. 432, <i>et seq.</i> Mommsen’s work also gives
some space to the subject. False coining and money-clipping were of
course prevalent in this age and punishable capitally, but there was also
a class of magnates who arrogated to themselves the right of coining, a
privilege conceded in earlier times, and who maintained private mints
for the purpose. In spite of legal enactments some of them persisted in
the practice, and their penalty was to be aggregated with all their
apparatus and operatives to the Imperial mints, there to exert their skill
indefinitely for the government; Cod. Theod., IX, xxi, xxii. Their lot
suggests the Miltonic fate of Mulciber:</p>

of Byzantine life at the point of time dealt with, it has often been necessary
to have recourse to writers both of earlier and later date; an
exigency, however, almost confined to Chrysostom and Constantine
Porphyrogennetos. In taking this liberty I have exercised great caution
so as to avoid anachronisms; and if such exist I may fairly hope them
to be of a kind which will not easily be detected. I have always tried to
obtain some presumptive proof in previous or subsequent periods that
the scene as represented may be shifted backwards and forwards through
the centuries without marring its truth as a picture of the times. In these
unprogressive ages, wherever civilization was maintained, it often had

beliefs already proclaimed as mythical by too astute critics; see Lanciani,
<i>The Athenaeum</i>, 1899. In any case the legends and hearsay as to their origin, current

indications as to national proclivities, which must rescue them from

Brindisi. It was about fifteen feet wide, with raised footpaths proportionately
narrow. The only road in the Eastern Empire with a special name
was the Via Egnatia, leading from the coast of the Adriatic through
Thessalonica to Cypsela (Ipsala, about forty miles north of Gallipoli).
The Antonine Itinerary shows the distance between most of the towns
and ports in the Empire (<i>c. 300</i>). The Tabula Peutingeriana is a sort of
panoramic chart on which towns, roads, mountains, forests, etc., are
marked without any approach to delineating the outline of the countries,
except in the vicinity of the Bosphorus and CP. (third century, but
brought up to a later date; about 15 feet × 1). There is a photographic
reproduction, Vienna, 1888. Strabo (IV, iii, 8) notes how careless the
Greeks were, as compared with the Romans, in the matter of public
works of ordinary utility.</p>

Privatarum (his local agents were called <i>Rationales</i>, but seem from the
Notitia to have become extinct in the East), but the Praefect was the
chief minister of finance and ruled both the returns and the disbursements;
see Godefroy’s Notitia, <i>ad calc.</i>; Cod. Theod.; Jn. Lydus, De
Magistr., ii, 27; Cassiodorus, Var. Epist., vi, 3, etc. The Rectors and
the Curiae could levy local rates for public works, to which purpose a
third of the revenue from the customs in each district and from national
estates (mostly property of abolished temples) was regularly devoted;
see Cod. Theod., XV, i, with Godefroy’s paratitlon and commentaries.
The Emperor indulged his fancy in building out of the public funds or
granted sums in the form of largess, as when Anastasius bestowed a considerable
amount on the island of Rhodes to repair the damage done by
an earthquake; Jn. Malala, xvi. There were some small taxes I have
not noticed, such as the <i>siliquaticum</i>, pay for the army, by which each

it was thought a considerable achievement when that general raised the
income of the Republic to the trifling sum, according to modern ideas,
of £3,500,000; Plutarch, Pompey, 45. On the other hand we have
the statement of Vespasian, a century later, that he needed close on
£400,000,000 to keep the Empire on its legs, a sum almost equal to
the requirements of modern Europe, but the scope of his remark is not
plain; Suetonius, Vespas., 16. Antoninus Pius, again, with the finances
of the whole Empire under his hand during his reign of twenty-three
years saved £22,000,000, nearly the same amount per annum as
Anastasius for a similar extent of territory; Dion Cass., lxxiii, 8.
Such small savings by the most thrifty emperors do not argue a large
income. In our own best years a surplus may reach about five per cent.
of the receipts. This gives us grounds for a guess that the revenue of
Rome after Augustus was something like £20,000,000.</p>

But the infantile credulity of the man in theological matters abates much

of the Deity was correct when, for the benefit of the Persian king, he
allowed a Christian bishop to release a treasure guarded by demons
whom the Magi had failed to exorcise. He believes implicitly that an
orthodox bishop emerged from the flames intact so as to convince an

<p><a id="Footnote_866" href="#FNanchor_866" class="label">[866]</a> There seems to be no good reason why children should not now be
taught from a primer of scientific cosmology, and have a catechism of
ethics as well to the exclusion of everything mythological. The human
brain is a weak organ of mind, and requires, above all things, a tonic
treatment. Nothing can be more enfeebling than any teaching which
causes children to imagine that they are surrounded by unseen intelligences
having the power to affect them for good or evil. In most
instances, a mind so subdued never recovers its resiliency; liberty of
thought is always hampered by dread of the invisible; and many of our
greatest men have been unable in after life to free themselves from this
fatuity. There should, however, be places of public assembly where
people could resort for ethical direction and encouragement, without the
lessons taught being vitiated or nullified by being made to depend on
mythology. But the objectionable name “agnostic” should be discarded,
as if to be properly educated were to belong to a peculiar sect. It suggests
a country in which a special designation has to be given to all who
are neither diseased nor deformed.</p>

Synesius pictures the schools as deserted when he visited Athens (<i>c. 410</i>);
no philosophers, no painted porches, nothing in evidence but the jars of
honey from Hymettus. Hypatia, in fact, was attracting every one to
Alexandria. After her murder, however, it doubtless began to recuperate
(<i>c.</i> 415). Themistius inveighs against those parents who sent their sons
to a <i>place</i> on account of its repute, instead of looking out for the <i>best
man</i>. He mentions that pupils came to him at CP. from Greece and
Ionia; Or., xxvii; xxiii. The students of this age are described as
extremely fractious. At Athens, a great commotion greeted the arrival
of a freshman, who was put through a rude ordeal until they had passed
him into the public bath, whence he issued again as an accepted comrade;
Gregory Naz., Laud. Basil., 16. There also they fought duels, and
Libanius reprobates their presenting themselves to him slashed with
knives; Epist., 627; Himerius, Or., xxii. Practical jokes amongst
themselves, or played on the professors, were often pushed by the
students to the verge of criminality; Pand. praef., 2(9). At Carthage
St. Augustine found his class for rhetoric so unruly that he threw it up
and migrated to Rome. There, indeed, they were more orderly, but
indulged in the galling practice of flocking in a body to a certain teacher,
whom they suddenly abandoned after a time, forgetting to pay their fees.
Sick of it all, he eagerly closed with an offer of the P. U. to take up a
salaried post at Milan; Confess., v, 8, 12, 13.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_884" href="#FNanchor_884" class="label">[884]</a> Themistius fairly covers the ground as to this question; Or., xxi;

accused him of requiring a talent (£240?), but he asked nothing at CP.
where he was subsidized; on the contrary, he assisted needy pupils.
Still, he received a great deal of money as presents. At Antioch, where
it was the custom, he took fees like the rest. For more ancient times
and generally, see Cresollius, <i>op. cit.</i>, v, 3, 4, etc. What the government
paid is uncertain. Augustus gave V. Flaccus £800 a year for acting
exclusively as tutor to his nephews; Suetonius, De Ill. Gram., 17.
£1,040 has been conjectured as the salary of Eumenius (600,000 <i>nummi</i>,
<i>op. cit.</i>). In Diocletian’s Act for fixing prices, ordinary schoolmasters
are allowed only about 4<i>s.</i> a month, professors 12<i>s.</i>; for each pupil in a
class, of course. The case of M. Aurelius bestowing £400 per ann. on
the professors at Athens is also to be noted; Dion Cass., lxxxi, 31.</p>

gives many particulars as to his own bringing up in childhood. Greek
nursemaids were hired at Rome so that young children might learn the
language; Tacitus, De Caus. Cor. Eloq., 29. Wooden or ivory letters
were used as playthings. These schoolmasters are represented as very
harsh instructors, who cowed the spirit of their pupils. The rod was
freely used, and chiefly by the paedagogue. Even scholars of maturer
age were corrected by whipping. Libanius used to “wake up the lazy
ones with a strap, the incorrigible he expelled.” Epist., 1119. Chrysostom
himself accepts as axiomatic that nothing can be done with boys
without beating; Act. Apost. Hom. xlii, 4 (in Migne, ix, 308).

by the wall-paintings recovered at Rome and Pompeii, many of which
are highly meritorious. For succeeding centuries a series of sculptures
remain which allow us to keep the retreat of art in constant view. The
chief landmarks are: 1. The arch of Titus and the column of Trajan;
2. The Antonine column and the arch of Severus; 3. The arch of Constantine,
remarkable for its crudity and for some spaces being filled by
figures ravished from that of Titus; 4. The Theodosian column at CP.;
though much defaced, the incapacity of the executant is still recognizable.
The reproduction of the Arcadian pillar published by Banduri (see
p. 49) cannot be regarded as a faithful copy, it being evident that the
artist has elevated the bas-reliefs to his own standard. In Agincourt,

she is to begin psalm-singing and reading of prophets, apostles,

Cyprian, Athanasius, and Hilarius. She should spend much time in

this may be due merely to the usual poverty of the career. The Church
should fall to principle not to poverty. And here we may catch a glimpse
of the process by which the various Protestant sects may ultimately die
out naturally: that young men of high character, ambitious of honourable
distinction, will avoid a profession which entails an attitude of disingenuous
reserve towards those whom they are deputed to instruct.
On the other hand it may be foreseen that the Romish and Orthodox
churches, upholding as they do a gross superstition and instituting the
members of their priesthood almost from childhood, will retain their
power over the masses for a much longer period, until at last they
have to face suppression by force. Those who at the present time are
engaged in impressing a belief in obsolete mythologies on the community
should realize that they are doing an evil service to their generation
instead of exerting themselves for the liberation and elevation of thought.

<p><a id="Footnote_950" href="#FNanchor_950" class="label">[950]</a> Avowed atheists were rare among the Greeks, as there was always
some personal risk in ventilating opinions which clashed with the
popular superstitions. Some, however, incurred the odium of holding
such views. Of these the most noteworthy was Diagoras, who is said
to have impiously chopped up his image of Hercules to boil his turnips;
Athenagoras, Apol., 4. The jaunty impiety of Dionysius, tyrant of
Syracuse (<i>c. 400</i> <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), was celebrated in antiquity. After pillaging
the temple of the Locrian Proserpine, he sailed back home and, finding
the wind favourable, remarked to his companions, “See what a fine
passage the gods are granting to us sacrilegious reprobates.” He seized
the golden cloak from the shoulders of Jupiter Olympus, observing
that it was “too heavy for summer and too cold for winter, whereas a
woollen one would suit him well for all seasons.” Noticing a gold
beard on Æsculapius at Epidaurus, he removed it, saying, that it was
“improper for him to wear it, since his father, Apollo, was always represented
beardless.” Whenever in the temples he met with statues
proffering, as it were, jewels and plate with their projecting hands, he
took possession of the valuables, asserting that it “would be folly not
to accept the good things offered by the gods.” The pious were aghast
at the example of such a man enjoying a long and prosperous reign and
transmitting the throne to his son; Cicero, De Nat. Deor., iii, 34;
Lactantius, Div. Instit., ii, 4, etc. With a view to such instances,
Plutarch wrote a treatise to prove that “the mills of God grind slow,
but very sure.” Euhemerus and Palaephatus transformed mythology
into history by a rationalizing process, assigning the origin to popular
exaggeration of common occurrences.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_951" href="#FNanchor_951" class="label">[951]</a> A system of verbal trickery originated with the Eleatics, of which
Zeno (<i>c. 400</i> <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) was the chief exponent. Their catches were generally
ingenious; that disproving the reality of motion is best known—“If
a thing moves, it must do so in the place in which it is, or in a
place in which it is not; but it cannot move in the place in which it is,
and it certainly does not move in a place in which it is not; therefore
there is no motion at all;” Diogenes Laert., Pyrrho, 99, etc. See
Plato’s Euthydemus for a sample of ridiculous word-chopping.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_952" href="#FNanchor_952" class="label">[952]</a> There were six principal sects which achieved a sort of permanency
and retained their vitality for several centuries. They may be characterized
briefly: Academics (Plato), sceptical and respectable; Peripathetics
(Aristotle), inquisitive and progressive; Stoics (Zeno of Citium,
Chrysippus), ethical and intense; Cynics (Antisthenes, Diogenes),
squalid, morose, and sententious; Epicureans, tranquil enjoyment and
indifference; Cyreneans (Aristippus), pure hedonism with discretion.
In general the Epicureans are wrongly associated with the last conception.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_953" href="#FNanchor_953" class="label">[953]</a> Aristotle (<i>c. 350</i> <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) was the first to perceive the importance of
collecting facts and disposing them into their proper groups. Thus
zoology, botany, anatomy, physiology, mineralogy, astronomy, meteorology,
etc., began to take form in his hands, each being relegated to a
separate compartment for consideration as a concordant whole and to
receive future additions.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_954" href="#FNanchor_954" class="label">[954]</a> Even with his limited outlook Aristotle had sufficient astuteness to
divine that nature might become the “slave of man,” and expresses
himself clearly to that effect; Metaphysics, i, 2. Such a claim may
provoke a smile from the modern who reviews the mild conquests of the
embryo science of his day.</p>

<p>Such unbelief, however, did not penetrate beyond the upper social
stratum; and even at Athens in the second century those who scouted
the ancient myths were considered to be impious and senseless by the
multitude; see Lucian, Philopseudes, 2, etc. The voluminous dialogues
of Cicero are sufficient to prove how practised the Romans had become
in tearing the old mythology to pieces. But the pretence of piety was
kept up in the highest places. “The soul of Augustus is not in those
stones,” exclaimed Agrippina in a moment of vexation when she found
Tiberius sacrificing to the statues of his predecessor; Tacitus, Ann.,

million of Jews rushed frantically to destruction in the wake of Barcochebas,
the leader of their revolt under Hadrian, though not without the
satisfaction of dragging 100,000 Gentiles to their doom at the same time.
Some exegetes are tempted to see in John, v, 4, an allusion to this war,
and hence to find a date for that gospel (the bridge, via Philo Judaeus,
between Judaeism and Hellenism), <i>c.</i> 140.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_981" href="#FNanchor_981" class="label">[981]</a> Rufus (or Fufius) and Rubellius are probably meant; Lactantius,

Jn. Malala onwards; also articles on biblical chronology in recent encyclopaedias,
Chron. of Eusebius, Consular Fasti appended to Chron.
Paschal., etc. By the synoptical gospels the ministry of Jesus seems to
have lasted one year only, but two, three, and even four years have been
assumed from the later composition of John, <i>e.g.</i>, in Jerome’s chronicle,

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_982" href="#FNanchor_982" class="label">[982]</a> It is, however, improbable that any Christian could have given a
consecutive account of the life of Jesus prior to 120 or thereabouts. The
newly-discovered Apology of Aristides seems to be the earliest evidence
for the existence of gospels. It was presented to Hadrian, perhaps,
<i>c.</i> 125. On the other hand First Clement, moored at 95, but with an
incorrigible tendency to rise to 140, is clearly by a writer who possessed
no biography, but merely Logia of Jesus.</p>

whole book which contains it has been stigmatized as a forgery by some
investigators; see Gieseler, Eccles. Hist., i, 33, for refs. The same
suspicion rests, in fact, on every early allusion to the Christians. It certainly
seems strange that they should be such unfamiliar sectaries to
Trajan and Pliny if they were well known at Rome under Nero and
Domitian. Much less can we believe that in the destruction of Jerusalem
Titus was actuated chiefly by a desire to extinguish Christianity, or that
he had weighed the differences in theological standpoint between Jews
and Christians; Sulp. Severus, Hist. Sacr., ii, 30. Such is history “as
she was wrote” at that epoch. The whole evidence that Christians were
popularly known and recognized politically during the first century is
scanty and unsatisfactory. Trajan achieved a great reputation, which
never died out even among the Christians, perhaps on account of the
tolerant attitude attributed to him on this occasion. He was prayed out
of hell by one of the popes along with one or two other noted pagans
whom the Church was anxious to take under its wing.</p>

miracles being still believed in by supposing them to have occurred as
an “extension of the natural.” In this way it may become credible that
cartloads of baked bread and cooked fish—vertebrate animals with all
their physiological parts—suddenly sprang into existence out of the air.
A travesty of the ridiculous, not an extension of the natural, is the more
proper description of such assumptions. Natural phenomena, observed,
but so far ill understood, lie in quite a different plane from contradictions
of natural law in which consists the essence of legendary miracles.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_995" href="#FNanchor_995" class="label">[995]</a> The more timorous critics still cling to one or two of the Epistles
grouped together under the name of St. Paul, but the advanced school
has decided to reject them in their entirety; see Van Manen, Encycl.
Biblica, <i>sb.</i> “Paul.” I may exemplify the general discrepancy of views
still prevailing in this field of research by a single illustration: “It has
now been established that the latter (Epistles of Ignatius) are genuine”;
Encycl. Britan., <i>sb.</i> “Gospels” and “Ignatius”: “certainly not by
Ignatius”; Encycl. Biblica, <i>sb.</i> “Old Christ. Lit.” Such opposing
statements will continue to be put forward as long as we have Faculties
of Divinity at Universities filled by scholars who are constrained to treat
historical questions in conformity with the requirements of an established
ministry; and so long shall we be edified by the spectacle of men engaged
in balancing truth and error in such a manner as to pretend not to be
refuting the latter, so that in perusing their treatises we must either
suspect their candour or distrust their judgement. Yet in not a few instances
the men may be observed exulting amid the ruins of the fortress
which they had entered to hold as an invincible garrison.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_996" href="#FNanchor_996" class="label">[996]</a> A. D. Loman decided in 1881 that Jesus had not been a real
personage, but he now thinks he went too far; Encycl. Biblica, <i>sb.</i>
“Resurrection.” Edwin Johnson, author of <i>Antiqua Mater</i>, 1887, has
marshalled the evidence against his existence very fully and fairly, but
in some of his later work he has gone too far, and such exaggerated
scepticism, while it may often amuse, can scarcely succeed in convincing.
Jn. M. Robertson, author of A Short History of Christianity, 1902, and
previous works of some magnitude from similar studies, argues on the
same side. Havet says, “Sa trace dans l’histoire est pour ainsi dire
imperceptible”; Le Christianisme, iii, 1878, p. 493. Bruno Brauer
concludes that “the historic Jesus becomes a phantom which mocks all
the laws of history”; Kritik d. evang. Geschichte, 1842, iii, p. 308;
see also Frazer’s Golden Bough, 1900, iii, p. 186, <i>et seq.</i> Disregarding
the Gospels, a form of narrative which could not be accepted by us as
historical in connection with any other religion, the slight allusions to
Jesus in known writers (Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius), are evidently
mere hearsay derived from the Christians themselves. Hegesippus, a
lost church historian (<i>c.</i> 170), gives some details as to the death of
“James, the brother of the Lord,” and also states that some poor
labourers of Judaea, for whom a descent from the Holy Family was
claimed, were brought before Domitian and dismissed as of no account;
fragments in Eusebius, Hist. Eccles., iii, 20. Remarkable is the
silence, in his voluminous writings, of Philo Judaeus, a philosophico-theological
Jew of Alexandria, a prominent citizen, and a man of middle
age at the time of the Crucifixion. So close to the scene itself he could
scarcely have failed to have heard of any popular agitation centring
round a Messiah at Jerusalem. When Augustus was told that Herod
had executed two of his sons he observed that “it was better to be
Herod’s pig than his son.” In ignorant repetition at a later date this
remark was construed into an allusion to the slaughter of the innocents;
Macrobius, ii, 4. Several (non-extant) Jewish historians, Justus
Tiberiensis for example, made no mention of Jesus. Still worse is the
case for the Apostles; they are not noticed outside the N. T. unless in
Acts conceded on all hands to be apocryphal. Most singular is it that
no descendants of theirs were ever known. Towards the middle of the
second century when the Christians loom into view as a compact body
of co-religionists we should assuredly expect to find relations of the
Apostles, direct or collateral, moving with extraordinary prestige among
the Saints on earth. But, beyond a vague allusion to two daughters of
Philip (Eusebius, Hist. Eccles., iii, 39), there is no trace of any such
individuals. The descendants of Mahomet alone were numerous a
century after his death, but the Twelve proved as barren of progeny as
if they had never existed. With respect to the canon of the N. T. it is
known that it was formed almost as at present before the third century,
a great many similar works being put aside as apocryphal or unsuitable.
Those selected were altered to some extent to meet the requirements of
doctrine; Origen c. Celsum, ii, 27; Dionysius of Corinth in Eusebius,
<i>op. cit.</i>, iv, 23, etc. They were, in fact, edited from time to time in the
interests of orthodoxy or heresy, interchangeable terms, as is shown by
Origen, Epiphanius, and Jerome; see Nestle’s Textual Criticism, Lond.,
1899. Much of the Apocrypha remains to this day, including circumstantial
accounts of the childhood of Jesus; see Clark’s Ante-Nicene
Library, in which Tatian’s Diatessaron (<i>c.</i> 170, an Arabic version only
remains), shows the absence of texts now found in the Gospels, especially
that relating to the Church being founded on a rock (Peter). The striking
likeness between the legend of Buddha (<i>c.</i> 500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), and the life of
Jesus has been set forth by several Orientalists; see Seydel, Die Buddha-Legende
und das Leben Jesu, 1884. The resemblance to early Egyptian
folklore may be seen in Griffith’s High Priests of Memphis (story of
Khammuas), 1900 (from recent demotic papyri). Some interesting
questions are raised in Mead’s Did Jesus Live 100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>? (on Talmudic
legends or libels). It must be borne in mind that scarcely a MS. of a
classical author (excepting some scraps recently recovered in Egypt)
exists, which has not passed the pen of monkish copyists. Hardouin taxes
them with having forged nearly all patristic literature, both Greek and
Latin. They had, he says, suitable materials for various ages, parchments,
inks, etc., and executants who practised various styles of writing.
In recording his conclusions he deprecates the accusation of insanity.
Such is the deliberate verdict of a Roman Cardinal whose learning is
indisputable, and whose discrimination in other matters has not been
impugned; Ad Censur. Vet. Script. Prolegomena, Lond., 1766. At any
rate the acknowledged forgeries make up an enormous bulk, Gospels,
Acts, Epistles, laws, decretals, etc. It seems scarcely possible that the
question as to the existence of Jesus and the Twelve can ever be definitely
disposed of; and it must take its place beside such problems as to
whether there was ever a Siege of Troy, a King Arthur, etc. In the
cases of Pope Joan and William Tell, local and contemporary records
were obtainable sufficiently comprehensive to prove a negative; but no
evidence is likely to come to hand close enough to exclude the credible
details of the Gospel narrative from the possible occurrences at Jerusalem
during the period. The English reader now possesses in the Encyclopaedia
Biblica, a repertory in which Biblical investigations are treated
in a manner as free from bias and obscurantism as is attainable at the
present time. Such a work has long been needed in English literature,
and marks a national advance. But much more remains to be done, and
within a score or two of years we may see such discussions take up a
stable position between the advanced critics who still feel obliged to
entertain some illogical propositions, and the rather wild free-lances
who would dissipate all marvel-tainted evidence by their uncompromising
scepticism, in which they sometimes do more harm than good by
their disregard of critical sanity. By that time a liberal application of
the critic’s broom will have swept many documents now held up to
public respect into the limbo to which they properly belong.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_997" href="#FNanchor_997" class="label">[997]</a> Previous to the overthrow of Biblical and other ancient cosmogonies
by the extension of natural knowledge the historic inquiry as to the
truth of supernatural religion was paramount. As recently as the
fifties of the last century a sceptic, if asked to give reasons for his disbelief,
might have answered that it was due to the absence of witnesses
of known position and integrity to attest the occurrences; and
that if such evidence were forthcoming he should certainly consider that
Christianity rested on foundations which could never be shaken. Let us
see whether it is in our power to prove that if a religion based on
miracles could pass such an ordeal it would not necessarily even then
hold an impregnable position. In 1848 certain phenomena, termed the
“Rochester knockings,” occurring at a place in New England, impelled
a wave of credulity as to spiritual manifestations throughout Christendom,
which has not wholly subsided up to the present date. Prof. Robt.
Hare, an eminent chemist and electrician, was attracted to investigate
the matter with the firm intention of exposing the folly. But he became
convinced instead, and by the aid of a lady who could produce “raps,”
apparently unconnected with her person, he devised a code of signals from
which resulted a couple of bulky volumes devoted by the professor to
explicit details of the doings in, and the beauties of, the spirit-land, the
whole recounted by deceased relations of his own; Spiritualism Scientifically
Demonstrated, New York, 1855. But the spirits did not for long
restrict themselves to merely audible signs; they responded generously
to the attention paid to them and soon began to reveal their hands,
faces, and even their whole persons for physical observation, often
pelting the audience with flowers, presenting them with bouquets, and
showing themselves to be accomplished musicians in the negro mode by
performances on unseen instruments. Although their deeds were never
dark, yet they always insisted on darkness as indispensable for the perpetration
of them. In 1852, after the craze reached England, many men
of academical and scientific repute observed and attested incredible
phenomena, of which Prof. Challis of Cambridge said that, if the statements
had to be rejected, “the possibility of ascertaining facts by
human testimony must be given up.” Mr. A. R. Wallace, the congener
of Darwin, became a convert, and bore witness to the miracles of
Mrs. Guppy, her floral materializations, etc.; Modern Miracles and
Spiritualism, 1874, etc. (I cannot omit to mention that this author, at
one time at least, was an anti-vaccinationist). Sir W. Crookes, the
celebrated scientist, had séances in his own house, where he walked and
talked with a young lady from the Orient, dead a century before, subjected
her to a quasi-medical examination, and possessed himself of a
lock of her hair; Researches on the Phenomena of Spiritualism, 1870.
The professors of Leipzig University received the celebrated medium,
Dr. Slade, in their private study on several occasions, when he satisfied
them of his ability to perform the impossible by producing untieable
knots, passing matter through matter, and causing writing to appear on
slates from invisible correspondents; Transcendental Physics, by Prof.
Zöllner, Lond., 1883. Other observers who upheld the reality of
spiritual achievements are Sir R. Burton, Mr. Cromwell Varley,
F.R.S., Dr. Lockhart Robinson, Lord Lindsay, etc. The list of
veracious witnesses is, in fact, a long one and a weighty. Yet all these
eminent men have been deceived by cunning impostors. See the
Reports of the Societies for Psychical Research, English and American,
which have been issued regularly for nearly twenty years. Hallucinations,
ghost-stories, and hypnosis have been exhaustively investigated,
but no spirits have ventured to materialize themselves whenever conclusive
tests were insisted on. At the most it has been demonstrated
that telepathy, a kind of wireless telegraphy between brain and brain,
may occur under favourable but rare conditions. Whenever trickery
was excluded the pretended mediums were invariably unsuccessful. The
redoubtable Dr. Slade, when he found that dupes failed him, retired
from the profession, and shortly after, on meeting a friend who challenged
him, replied, “you never believed in the old spirits, did you?”
The absurdities which were effective among the credulous when their
superstitions were appealed to were often a ludicrous feature. A stone
picked up by the wayside and ejected adroitly from the medium’s
pocket during a dance is looked upon as a supernatural occurrence.
See Truesdell’s ridiculous exposure of Slade and other charlatans of
that class; Bottom Facts of Spiritualism, N.Y., 1883. The career of an
English impostor has been unveiled throughout by a confederate in
Confessions of a Medium, Lond., 1882. The literature on both sides is
very large and is still accumulating. Several spiritual journals are published
with the support of thousands of believers in Europe and America,
etc. This modern illustration teaches us very conclusively: (1) That had
the Gospels come down to us as the acknowledged writings of some of
the best known and trustworthy men of antiquity, their contents would
still have to be discredited as originating in fraud or illusion: (2) That
devotion to a branch of science, or even to science generally, is not
essentially productive of any critical insight into matters theological or
professedly supernatural: (3) That phenomena of cerebration, normal,
aberrant, and perhaps supranormal (exalted sensitiveness), may easily
be utilized for purposes of imposture; and are a proper subject for
methodized psychical study. Since a contemporary religion, supported
by a mass of direct and definite evidence thus collapses before a strict
scrutiny, we must ask what truth could reside in those generated in the
womb of Oriental mysticism, for which no solid foundations can be perceived?
When we see that even scientists do not always succeed in
persuading themselves that nothing is credible but fact, <i>quod semper,
quod ubique, quod omnibus demonstrabile sit</i>, how little reliance can be
placed on popular reports and unauthentic tracts. Even if we had not
spiritualism to hand, a practically similar lesson might be taught from a
consideration of Shakerism, Mormonism, Harris’s Brotherhood of the
New Life, the Zion Restoration Host, with its reincarnated Elijah, etc.
See Oxley’s Modern Messiahs, 1889, for many interesting details as to
popular illusionists who have assumed the prophet’s mantle.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1005" href="#FNanchor_1005" class="label">[1005]</a> There was no creed in Neoplatonism, and, therefore, what was
believed has to be deduced from a study of the Enneads of Plotinus, so-called
as consisting of a series of books, six in all, each containing nine
treatises. The logical germ of the conception is that the One emits continually
the Nous or intelligence; and the latter the Soul. The Soul
animates the world, but becomes lost should it allow itself to coalesce
with matter by yielding to sin. The subject has been treated exhaustively
by Vacherot, L’école d’Alexandrie, Paris, 1846; and by Zeller,
Philosophie der Griechen, iii, Leipzig, 1881. Neither of these works
has been translated, but there is an excellent summary by Bigg (Neoplatonism,
Lond., 1892), who has dealt with some phases of the movement
at length in his Christian Platonists of Alexandria, 1886. According
to Bigg’s expression, the Christian Father, Clement Alex. (<i>c.</i> 190),
“separated the thinker from the thought, and thus founded Neoplatonism.”
Numenius, who was, perhaps, a Jew, made some advances in
the definition of the Platonic trinity; and Plotinus was accused of
borrowing from him; see Bigg’s latter work, pp. 64, 250, etc. Ammonius
Saccas, a porter of Alexandria, was the teacher of Plotinus, and is considered
to be the immediate begetter of Neoplatonism.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1006" href="#FNanchor_1006" class="label">[1006]</a> Philo Judaeus (<i>c.</i> 20) is the first known to have taught this doctrine
of ecstasy, but it is not certain that the Neoplatonists utilized his works.
He also was the first to corrupt the rigid monotheism of the Jews by
assuming the Platonic (?) Logos as a necessary mediator between Jehovah
and the world; see Harnack, History of Dogma, Lond., 1892, i, p. 115,
etc.; also Bigg as above, and the Histories of Philosophy by Zeller,
Ueberweg, etc.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1007" href="#FNanchor_1007" class="label">[1007]</a> The details of the life of Plotinus are due to Porphyry, who gives
the most succinct account of his doctrine, and describes his excursions
into the higher sphere by means of self-hypnosis. The whole field of
modern spiritualism seems to have been cultivated by the Neoplatonists,
and, indeed, by other mystics long before; allusions by Plotinus himself
will be found in Enneads, v, 9; vi, 7; iii, 8, etc. Porphyry relates
that during the six years of his intimacy with him, his master attained
to ecstatic union on four occasions. It will be seen, therefore, that
Plotinus was very abstemious in indulging in such a luxury; he would
have much to learn from modern improvements under which Mrs. Piper
and other trance-mediums enter the vacuous realm regularly day by day;

(Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics, Lond., 1892) for an account of their
conceits. Philo Judaeus performed a similar service for the Pentateuch,
of which the Jews do not seem to have believed much literally in his
day; nor, in fact, did the early Christian Fathers; see Origen, Comment.
in Genesim, etc. He notices, amongst other things, the difficulty which
arises from the production of light before the sun was created; Gen., i,
3, 16. Porphyry’s treatise on the Cave of the Nymphs (Odyssey, xiii,
102) remains to show the method of exegesis adopted by the Neoplatonists
in order to demonstrate the divine inspiration of the old Greek
poets. Kingsley’s novel, “Hypatia,” gives a good picture of Neoplatonism
in some of its popular aspects.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1010" href="#FNanchor_1010" class="label">[1010]</a> A treatise emanating from the school of Iamblichus is extant, viz.,
The Mysteries of the Egyptians, an exposition supposed to be written
by Abamon in answer to a sceptical letter from Porphyry to Anebo,
assumed characters apparently. It includes a whole system of Neoplatonic
magic and theurgy, and describes the various appearances of daemonic
phantasms with the accuracy of one accustomed to be familiarly
associated with them. Objectively the series descends from the celestial
light which defines the personality of a god to a turbid fire indicative of
the form of a lower daemon, perhaps of malignant propensities. There
is a recent edition of this work in English, probably a venture addressed
to spiritualistic circles.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1012" href="#FNanchor_1012" class="label">[1012]</a> Mansel’s Gnostic Heresies (1875) supersedes to a great extent the
larger treatises of Matter and others, as it embodies a discussion of details
more recently derived from Hippolytus, etc. Their sects increased
rapidly in number, from the thirty-seven dealt with by Irenaeus (<i>c.</i> 185),
to the eighty refuted by Epiphanius (<i>c.</i> 350). There were two main
schools of Gnostics, the Syrian and the Alexandrian. The former was
frankly dualistic, but the Egyptian assimilated Buddhistic notions, which
saw in matter the essence of evil; only, however, when vitalized by the
celestial emanations after they had become impoverished, as the result
of their descent to an infinite distance from the throne of light. In
general the attitude of Gnostics towards Christianity was rejection of
the Jewish creator as an evil demiurge, and the acceptance of Jesus as
an emissary from the god of love to rescue the world from sin and darkness.
Their Christology was docetic; that is, the Saviour was merely a
phantom who appeared suddenly on the banks of the Jordan, in the
semblance of a man of mature age. Their greatest leader, though not a
pure Gnostic, was Marcion of Pontus. His bible consisted of the Pauline
Epistles, and a Gospel said to be Luke mutilated, but more justly recognized
as an independent redaction of the primitive tradition.
Marcion’s Jesus said, “I come not to fulfil the law, but to destroy it”;
see Tertullian, Adv. Marcion, iv, 7, 9. The modern Christian might
imagine that his faith is dualistic, owing to the power and prominence
given to the devil, but such a view would be inexpiable heresy. Satan
and his crew are merely rebellious angels, whose relations to Jehovah
are similar to that of sinful men in general, so much so that some of
the Fathers in the early Church held that Christ would descend into
Hell to be crucified there a second time for the salvation of devils; see
Origen, De Principiis, I, vi, 2, 3; Labbe, Concil. (1759), ix, 533, can.

though less extensive, works, owing to the activity of modern
scholars among Oriental sources. St. Augustine was a Manichaean for
eight years, and the most reliable details are to be collected from his
writings after he became a Christian, and issued diatribes against his
former teachers. Socrates gives a short life of Mani, fabulous in great

the partly Semitic inhabitants of North Africa, among whom was
Augustine. But it permeated Europe as well, and in a more Christianized
form flourished among such comparatively modern sects as the
Cathari, Albigenses, Bogomils, etc. Its fate in these quarters is traced
out by Gieseler and other church historians. But the Manichaean pedigree
of these sects is not now accepted so freely as formerly; see Bury’s
Gibbon, vi, p. 543. At one time all heretics were stigmatized as
Manichaeans in the vituperation of the orthodox, especially when their
views approached the docetism held by all Gnostics, as in the case of
the Monophysites; Labbe, Concil., v, 147, etc.</p>

days it would last for six thousand years, and the seventh thousand
would be distinguished by the reign of Christ on earth; see the Church
Histories and Harnack’s article “Millennium,” in Encycl. Brit., etc.
As the chronology was uncertain the critical transition might be revealed
at any moment. Christian writers now began to date from the creation
of the world as per Genesis; some made it about 5500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, so that the
Millennium should have been entered on during the reign of Anastasius.

issued an edict of toleration. Hence there was really no call for Constantine
to legislate anew. This Hierocles was one of those who set up the
idealized Apollonius of Tyana as an avatar of the Deity, and tried to
exalt him as an object of adoration above Jesus. But the attempt failed;
Apollonius was a real personage with a familiar name; Jesus was a

accommodata”; Mosheim, Eccles. Hist., IX, ii, 3. The first great
theological debates concerned the mutual relations of the persons of the
Trinity in their celestial abode; and were decided against those who
confounded the persons (Sabellians, Monarchians) or divided the substance
(Arians). Such momentous matters being settled as finally
registered in the so-called Athanasian Creed, the Fathers descended to
earth and busied themselves in analyzing the mystic conjunction of the
Godhead with the flesh, viz., the Incarnation of Jesus. These controversies
were determined by the ejection from the fold of Orthodoxy of
those who maintained the existence of but one nature or one will in the
God-man (Monophysites, Monotheletes), and also of a small party who
propounded the incorruptibility of the body of Jesus (Aphthartodocetae).
The erection of this fabric of dogma was essential to Orthodoxy, the
underlying conception of which was that God became man so that man
might become God; ii Clement, 9; cf. Bigg, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 71. Hence if
the Saviour were made out to be merely a sham human being the whole
scheme of redemption must fall through at once. The last step led them
to consult about the mundane relatives of Jesus, and ended in the dogma
that Mary’s was an asexual birth, the Immaculate Conception, and that,
as she could never have been sullied by any carnal conversation, the
brothers of Jesus, as represented, must merely have been his cousins.
But the Church did not approach some of these latter considerations
till a later age.</p>

so little in evidence were those who still adhered to the old religion;
Cod. Theod., XVI, x, 22. But subsequent events proved that his confidence
was premature. I have anticipated the use of the word “Pagan”
(<i>paganus</i>, rustic, villager) as a term of reproach to those who had not
been illuminated by Christianity. In this sense it is first found in a law
of Valentinian I: Cod. Theod., XVI, ii, 18 (365). It arose at a time
when the urban population exhibited a sharp contrast to the country
people in the matter of religion. Long after the former had been converted
<i>en masse</i>, polytheism lingered in the rural districts, the scattered
inhabitants of which did not come into touch with the Christian propagandists
and their new creed for a considerable time. Hence the
idea of a country fellow became synonymous with that of a worshipper
of the gods long since despised.</p>

The whole title against heretics contains sixty-six laws, a monument of
Christian bigotry and intolerance. The novelty of the Christian doctrines
and the constant dissensions of ecclesiastics as to the proper mode
of apprehending them, caused all classes to be infected with a mania for
drawing theological distinctions, <i>ex. gr.</i>, “If you require some small
change, the person you address will begin to argue about ‘begotten and
unbegotten’; should you ask the price of bread you will hear that the
Father is greater and the Son inferior; or in reply to an inquiry whether
your bath is prepared, the attendant will define for your benefit that the
Son was made out of nothing”; Gregory Nys., Orat. De Deitate, etc.,
2 (in Migne, i, 557). Yet sometimes a prelate would assume a jocular
tone in the pulpit when speaking on these grave questions. Thus Eudoxius,
Bishop of CP., began his discourse one day with the assertion,
“The Father is impious, but the Son is pious.” The congregation
seemed awe-struck, but he at once continued, “Be not alarmed; the
Son is pious because he worships the Father, but the Father worships
no one”; Socrates, ii, 43. Marrast has devised some scenes to bring
out the absurd way in which theological hair-splitting disturbed everyday
social relations at this period; <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 89.</p>

that they looked like corpses wandering away from their graves. Some
lived in dens and caves where they could neither stand nor lie. Some
dwelt in the open air almost naked, exposed to excessive heat or cold.
Others rejected human food and took to grazing like cattle, shunning
human beings as if they were wild beasts. Both sexes embraced such
lives of unremitting castigation. Some of the males made a practice of
repairing from time to time to the cities in order to demonstrate their
sexual frigidity by bathing in the public baths amongst nude women.
They applied themselves to prayer, of course, until they brought themselves

<p><a id="Footnote_1052" href="#FNanchor_1052" class="label">[1052]</a> Epicurus, the unavowed disciple of Leucippus and Democritus, the
earliest atomists, conceived the coalescence of the particles to result
from their rushing onwards always under the influence of a certain
natural deflection which led to their meeting continually so as to become
conjoined. As an Academic, and, therefore, a sceptic, Carneades could
not accept this or any other theory, but in criticizing its fortuity, he
remarked that it might have been perfected, or, at least, made more
intelligible if Epicurus had conferred some faculty of will or intention
on his atoms; Cicero, De Finibus, i, 6; De Fato, 11. With our increased
knowledge of physics, we may now venture to supply the
deficiency in accordance with the suggestion of Carneades. Not even
in the process of crystallization can the motion of the atoms or molecules
be considered as fortuitous, since they seem to be borne towards each
other under the influence of some irresistible desire. The recent investigators
strongly uphold the vitality of the process.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1053" href="#FNanchor_1053" class="label">[1053]</a> The question of abiogenesis or spontaneous generation, remains still
indeterminate. Substances in transitional stages between the vital and
the non-vital state have not been observed; perhaps because such matter
is too inconspicuous to have been discovered so far and recognized, or,
it may be, that the swarm of germs by descent is now so great, that the
incipiently organic at once becomes their prey, and forms, perhaps, their
constant pabulum. If identical atoms underlie all kinds of matter, and
the recent <i>début</i> of electrons brings the proof appreciably nearer that it
is so, we are still at a loss to explain why they should at one time, by
their association, exhibit vital phenomena, and at another reveal to
us their versatility in aggregating under the species of gold, sulphur,
etc. The statement in the text might run that the chemical compounds
combine with each other in greater complexity to form the elements of
protoplasm.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_1054" href="#FNanchor_1054" class="label">[1054]</a> That the effective origin of evolution consists in will capable of
responding to a stimulus, being an essential attribute of matter, is a conclusion
to which we are led necessarily by a consideration of the subject.
When an amoeba protrudes a process, incited from within or without
by some desire, it is already on the way to evolve itself into a higher
form; and when a hygienist essays to preserve or prolong life by his
studies in bacteriology, etc., in his immeasurably higher sphere, he
literally does no more. The earlier evolutionists, Huxley, for example,
were inclined to hold that the potency of cosmic evolution became
evanescent progressively with the elaboration of purposive intelligence
and social institutions, but such a view is manifestly erroneous, and
would not now, I presume, be maintained by any contemporary scientists.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1055" href="#FNanchor_1055" class="label">[1055]</a> Our means of astronomical research are not sufficiently definite to
enable us to explain conclusively the appearance of previously unobserved
stars (<i>e.g.</i> Nova Persei, 1901), but there is good reason to suppose that
these new lights sometimes signal to us the catastrophe of millions of
beings more or less similar to ourselves. We are, however, well acquainted
with the convulsions of nature, which often bring swift destruction to
thousands of those dwelling on this small globe; for instance, the Mont
Pelée eruption of 1903, which claimed some 40,000 victims. It might
indeed be imagined from the occurrence of such disasters that animated
nature is merely a kind of surface disease of the earth, which undergoes
a spontaneous cure from time to time by means of earthquakes, floods,
volcanic action, etc. Certainly, if we are the only result of the activities
of this solar system, there would seem to be much superfluous expenditure
of power and materials. The conception of God, when cleared of
all irrelevancy, is merely that of a perpetual source of energy; and that
we must find in the medium we exist in or nowhere. It is nugatory to
talk of beginnings and endings when dealing with the infinite, unless as
regards phases of phenomena; if there had to be an end of the universe,
there would never have been a beginning.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1056" href="#FNanchor_1056" class="label">[1056]</a> Amongst some follies, the Stoic philosophers, in their pantheistic
conception of nature, reached the highest level which has yet been attained
in the expression of theocratic dogma. With them, the universe
is the very body of the divine essence, and the good and wise man is in
no way inferior to the sublimest manifestation of it. He is rightly called
a god upon earth, and his intellect is an efflux of the Deity. “Back to
the Porch for your ideas of God and nature,” the modern philosopher
may cry to his age. “You are gods yourselves, and nature is your realm
to conquer and hold in subjection.” The religion of the future will be
more akin to Stoicism than to any other doctrine which has been formulated
by thinkers in the past—a high ethical code upheld by a pride of
race and a devotion to the evolution of humanity. The Stoic would not
now be ready to make his own quietus with a bare bodkin should the
currents turn awry. He would stand to his post till the last hour, working
for the advancement of science. “Les stoiciens n’étaient occupés
qu’a travailler au bonheur des hommes, à exercer les devoirs de la
société: il semblait qu’ils regardassant cet esprit sacré qu’ils croyaient
être en eux-mêmes, comme une espèce de providence favorable qui
veillait sur le genre humain”; Montesquieu, Esprit des Lois, xxiv, 10.
See Plutarch, De Stoic. Repug., 13; Adv. Stoicos, 33; Seneca, De
Provid., 1; Epist., cvi; cxvii, etc.; Epictetus, ii, 8, 9; Lactantius, Div.
Inst., i, 5, 27, etc.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1057" href="#FNanchor_1057" class="label">[1057]</a> Accepting the identity of the evolutionary process at all grades of
its prepotency, we may suppose that future advancement will be the
result of deliberate effort; and that the more determinate such effort,
the more rapid must be the progress. While the aptitude of our faculties
must be increased by their being constantly exercised in study and research,
the knowledge attainable by such work may ultimately win for
us some controlling influence over our physiological constitution. The
wild dreams of mediaeval alchemists now seem to us less unreal since
we have had experience of the properties of radium; and the vision of
an <i>elixir vitae</i>, which illuded those investigators, appears more realizable
in the light of recent research. The arrest of senility may come
within the range of the future therapeutist; and a new Demeter may
subject the modern Triptolemus to some alchemical fire, to render him
proof against mortality. Less remotely, the systematic administration of
sexual associations would exert a powerful influence over mental and
bodily development; and it would be physiologically correct if famous
stallions should stand to cover brood mares in the human as well as in
the equine world. The Spartans realized something of this in practice;
Plutarch, Lycurgus. The tendency to equalization of the sexes which
has been growing of late years, is undoubtedly a forward movement on
the path of evolution. The possibility of man in the future being endowed
with greatly increased intellectual power must not be lost sight
of. Exceptional gifts of genius, in some cases uniquely manifested, and
the occurrence of “prodigies,” especially in relation to mathematics,
music, and art, teach that the mental faculties of the human race may
yet be evolved in a much higher degree. The limitations imagined by
Greg, which are, perhaps, generally entertained, must now be contemplated
with suspended judgement: “Two glorious futures lie before
us: the progress of the race here, the progress of the man hereafter.
History indicates that the individual man needs to be translated in order
to excel the past. He appears to have reached his perfection centuries
ago.... What sculptor has surpassed Phidias? What poet has transcended
Homer?” etc.; Enigmas of Life, 1891, p. 177. This is an
evident misconception of the pace at which evolution moves; such short
periods count for nothing. In evolutionary time, Homer and Phidias
are our contemporaries. We know nothing of the final state of such
beings as ourselves after they have passed through some millions of
years, to which most probably the life of this planet must extend. They
may well attain to some condition resembling that of the “gods” of
Epicurus, who existed with a “quasi corpus, quasi sanguis,” etc. The
chemist and biologist have a wide field before them in which they will
yet make many conquests.</p>

historical. On the other hand the Church History of Eusebius, who was
infinitely above them in abilities and learning, contains little but popular
report and legend. It is improbable that Julian inflicted any physical

the Romans themselves. The great Transatlantic Republic has been

<p><a id="Footnote_1061" href="#FNanchor_1061" class="label">[1061]</a> The first victims of ecclesiastical rancour were the Priscillianists,
who arose in Spain about 380. They were tainted with Manichaeism,
and two bishops persuaded the tyrant of Gaul, Maximus, to put several
of them to death in 385. Generally the Fathers of the Church were
shocked at this execution, but the utility of subjecting heretics to the
capital penalty was soon perceived and the practice thenceforward became
an intrinsic part of Christian discipline. The result is well known
to students of Church history and the religious wars waged against the
Paulicians, Albigenses, Huguenots, etc., and the horrors of the Inquisition
are familiar subjects in popular literature. During three centuries
in Spain (1471-1781), the first and the last scene of the judicial slaughter
of heretics, nearly 250,000 persons were dealt with by the Inquisitors,
a circumstance which Galton considers to have been equivalent to the
suppression of national genius and to account for “the superstitious
and unintelligent Spanish race of the present day”; see Hereditary
Genius, 1869, p. 359. The same reasoning would, of course, apply to
any process, such as is occurring in Russia at the present day, by which
the more active and effective members of a community are being constantly
weeded out. Paganism was not, of course, absolutely free from
intolerance; and the cases of Socrates, Anaxagoras, etc., will occur to
every one. Even Cleanthes, the Stoic, denounced Aristarchus of Samos
for running counter to the popular religion when he put forth some
astronomical anticipations of the Copernican system; Plutarch, De
Facie in Orbe Lunae, 6. Even Cicero in his “Laws” (ii, 8) decidedly
proscribes nonconformity with the state religion. Polytheism was tolerant
because it was comprehensive and could easily assimilate all kindred
beliefs. Thus a hospitable reception was ensured to any new arrival
who was fairly accredited as a member of the Olympian family.</p>

R. C. prelate when speaking of the Anglican clergy: “Do they claim
the power to produce the actual living Jesus Christ by transubstantiation
on the altar, according to the claims of the priesthood of the Eastern and
Western Churches?” Persons who address a public audience in the
Metropolis in this manner are not considered to be insane nor are they
classed as charlatans. Concomitantly with such proceedings we find
that the greatest of English encyclopaedias is published with introductory
articles in which it is allowed that the old religion is now a
mere phantasm on the stage of reality. At the present moment every
form of religious belief rests secure and stable on the broad back of
popular ignorance; and it remains for posterity in ages to come to solve
the problem as to how long humanity will have to wait for the evolution
of that elevation of mind which will decline to pay the tribute of hypocrisy

and their gradual extinction is due to the restrictions imposed
on them by civilization or to their becoming addicted to its vices. The
decrease of the U. S. Indians (303,000, 1880; 266,000, 1900; previous
decrease unknown) and of the Maoris (100,000, 1780; 46,000, 1901) is
partly due to conflicts with the whites, but that of the Hawaiians
(200,000, 1780; 31,000, 1900) results solely from the immigration of
higher races. Similarly the Tasmanians have become extinct in the last

perhaps a missionary, is more deadly to the native races than periodical

<p><a id="Footnote_1102" href="#FNanchor_1102" class="label">[1102]</a> The official record of the election by Peter Magister (<i>loc. supra cit.</i>)
has been preserved. It was Justin’s own duty to announce publicly that
the throne was vacant. The Circus was immediately filled and, as there
was no known claimant to the succession, a wild scene ensued. First
one of Justin’s subordinates was set up on a shield by a company of the
guards, but the Blues, disapproving, made a rush and dispersed the
throng. Then a patrician general was seized on by a body of the
Scholars, but the Excubitors attacked them and were dragging the
unlucky officer away to lynch him when he was rescued by the Candidate
Justinian, who was watching the tumult. Upon this the crowd
scurried round Justinian himself, but he declined the dangerous distinction,
being doubtless aware that a decisive election was maturing behind
the scenes among responsible representatives. Still, however, the
attempts to create an emperor went on, until at last the doors of the
Cathisma were thrown open and Justin appeared, supported by the
Patriarch, the Senate, and the chief military officers. All then perceived
that an emperor had been chosen by legitimate methods, and both
factions with the rest of the populace applauded the new monarch in the
usual way: “Justin Augustus, may you be victorious! Reign as you
have lived!” etc. It will be observed that Justin did not ascend the
throne as the emperor of the Blues or the Greens, but that both Demes
joined in their acquiescence. This apparently was always the case unless
some party usurper, such as Phocas, managed to seize the reins of
power; see Theophanes, an. 6094.</p>

of the Consistorium. It was generally anticipated that Anastasius would
have chosen a successor from one of his three nephews, Hypatius,
Pompeius, and Probus, all of whom he had raised to important positions.
His failure to do so is accounted for seriously by a singular story. Being
undecided as to which of them he should select to inherit the Empire,
he arranged that they should dine together at the Palace on a certain
day in an apartment by themselves. Here he provided three couches, on
which, according to custom, they would take a siesta after the meal.
One of these he designated in his own mind as the Imperial bed, and
kept watch in order to see which of them would occupy it. As it
happened, however, two of the three threw themselves down together
on the same couch, and the significant position remained vacant. Judging
that a higher power had ruled the event, he then prayed that his
successor might be revealed to him as the first person who should enter
to him next morning. This proved to be that very likely officer of his
household, Justin, a result which appears to have satisfied him; Anon.
Vales., 13. Such relations cannot be rejected in this age on the grounds
that so-and-so had too much good sense, etc. On the contrary, they
serve to indicate the mental calibre of the time. The slaughter of
several “Theos” as possible successors by Valens (Ammianus, xxix, 1)
may be remembered, and Zeno is said to have executed an unfortunate
silentiary anent of a silly prediction; Jn. Malala, xv; Theophanes, an.

to the reputed life of Justinian by his so-called tutor, Bogomil or Theophilus,
quoted implicitly by Alemannus, a historical puzzle for nearly
three centuries, but at last solved a few years ago; see Bryce, English
Hist. Rev., 1887. It is little more than a MS. leaflet (in the Barberini
library at Rome), and proves to be devoid of any sort of authenticity.
The chief non-corroborated statement is that Justinian spent some time
at Ravenna, as a hostage, with Theodoric the Goth. Justinian himself
was, in fact, a barbarian of some tribe, and the bogus name given him,

Spartans applauded the adulterous union of Acrotatus and Chelidonis,
because they seemed to be physically well matched for the production
of offspring; Plutarch, Pyrrhus. In fact Lycurgus thought that wives
might properly be lent to suitable mates for breeding purposes. As an

lyre, had made progress in geometry, and fortified herself by the study
of philosophy. Julia, the mother of Mark Antony, is called “a most
learned woman” by Cicero, Catiline, iv, 6. Greek culture was fashionable
at this time among the Romans. But an earlier Cornelia (<i>c.</i> 330

were several other places, and the custom was carried by the Semites as

(15). See the commentators on the passage of Herodotus; Strabo, XVI,
i, 20, etc. At all times the simplicity of devout females was liable to be
abused, several instances of which are recounted. For example, an
ancient rite ordained that a Phrygian damsel should on the eve of her
marriage bathe in the Scamander, whilst invoking the river-god to accept
her virginity. In this custom on one occasion a youth of the neighbourhood
found his opportunity. Hearing of the nuptials of a young lady
who was socially unapproachable to him, but of whom he had long been
enamoured, he bedizened himself with reeds and water-flowers and
posted himself in a recess to await her coming. On her entering the
water he came forward thus in the guise of the divinity she was supposed
to meet, and the guileless maid permitted him to embrace her without
resistance, devoutly unconscious of anything being wrong. Subsequently,
as she was walking in the bridal procession, her eyes fell upon him
among the spectators, whereupon she made him a profound obeisance
and pointed him out to those who accompanied her as the genius of the
sacred stream; Aeschines, Epist., 10. This was an isolated and comparatively
blameless case, but later on some of the semi-Christian
charlatans managed such matters wholesale; see the account of Marcus
in Irenaeus, i, 13.</p>

Her <i>régime</i> did not, however, last more than a year, being unable to
stem the tide of revolution in 1848. More fortunate was the <i>castrato</i>

prime minister under Philip V of Spain and his successor for nearly
twenty-five years. The reign of courtesans in the seventeenth century,
when the aristocratic blood of France and England was enriched by
“legitimated princes” and peers under Louis XIV and Charles II is too
well known to need comment here; but the acquisition of governmental
power at the hands of Louis XV by Jeanne Vaubernier (Countess Du

the ridiculous form of impounding her in a narrow cabinet next the
street, where she was forced to prostitute herself to all comers. Every
time she received a companion a jingling of little bells was kept up to
publish the circumstance to passers by. At the same period immense
underground bakeries were run by contractors for the supply of the Steps
(see <a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a>), and they hit on a remarkable expedient for procuring slaves
to work in them. Taverns served by prostitutes were set up contiguous
to the vaults; and customers, chiefly strangers, were lured into a compartment,
from which they were suddenly lowered into the cavity
beneath, by a sinking floor. There they ended their days in enforced
labour, being never again allowed to see the light. A bold soldier of
Theodosius, however, being thus entrapped, drew a dagger and fought

is one of the most marked features, and in every province the extremes
of sociological phenomena are commonly to be observed. Side by side
with measures for the total abolition of prostitution we find brothels
tolerated as a regular department of royal palaces. In 1546, for example,
prostitution was suppressed at Strasbourg, and at Toulouse in
1587. On the other hand, from the eleventh century onwards, a community
of courtesans was maintained as part of the establishment of
the kings of France. They were placed in the charge of an officer,
named <i>le Roi des Ribauds</i>. His position, however, was low, and his
right to eat at the same board with the other members of the household
was disputed; see Rabutaux, La Prostitution (<i>au moyen âge</i>), Paris,
1851, ff. 16, 21, 32, 33. Again, it is well authenticated, though almost
incredible, that in the sixteenth century nobles and generals of the south

purposes; see Bayle, <i>sb.</i> Bathyllus.</p>

account (with portrait) of Lola Montez, and her bold procedure
in dispensing with her <i>maillots</i>, “to the delight of the gentlemen of the
orchestra,” when dancing at Paris. Some may still remember the popularity
of “the Menken,” as Mazeppa at Astley’s, the result of her
having been counselled to turn “to account her fine physique”; see
Dic. Nat. Biog., <i>sb. nom.</i>, for her career and distinguished associates.
Her apology, protesting against the performance being denounced as an
exhibition of nakedness, was published, and is extant. This hetaira approached
somewhat to her Greek prototypes, and issued a volume of
poems, which, if not equal to Sappho’s, had a merit of their own. The
same significance cannot, however, be attached to such displays as at
the present day. The indiscriminate bathing was only just passing into
disrepute, and ingenuous exhibitions of that kind were still possible.
See, for instance, Aristaenetus (i, 7), where a “modest” young lady
trips down to the beach, coolly divests herself of her clothing, and asks
a young gentleman, who happens to be reclining there, to keep an eye
on her things while she is in the water. This author, waiting <i>c.</i> 500,
could scarcely have deemed such an incident preposterous in his time.

however, he has been censured, to the damage of his historical credit,
as if he thereby proved himself to be a dissolute person, unusually experienced
in the vices of the times. But the charge is unjust, and might
be urged with greater force against almost all of the Christian fathers
who continually inveigh against abuses of the sexual instinct, in the intricacies
of which they show themselves to be far better versed. Beginning
with the Epistle of Barnabas they never tire of decrying circumstantially
all sexual relations, especially those who “medios viros
lambunt, libidinoso ore inguinibus inhaerescunt”; Minucius Felix, 28;
cf. Arnobius, Adv. Gen., ii; Lactantius, Div. Inst., vi, 23, etc. Their
rigid text is “genitalem corporis partem nulla alia causa nisi efficiendae
sobolis accepimus”; <i>ibid.</i> Nor was it regarded as proper that the knowledge
and discussion of such matters should be ordinarily thrust out of
sight; on the contrary they were included in the category of topics
habitually invested with interest to “society.” Thus the polished Agathias
in an amatory epigram (28), after lamenting the pangs and torments of
love, makes his point with:</p>

late, not till 1731, by Ludewig. She was, in fact, in bad odour with the
Church, and the worst that could be said of her was acceptable. Recently
a further attempt has been made by Débidour (L’Impératrice
Theodora, Paris, 1885, Latin Thesis, 1877), called forth by Sardou’s well-known
play of <i>Theodora</i>, in which she is undoubtedly misrepresented.
A pendant to this <i>brochure</i>, containing all the facts of the defence, will
be found in Eng. Hist. Rev., 1887 (Mallet). Present flatterers were, of
course, ready to swear that she was an Anician! See p. <a href="#Page_308">308</a>.</p>

and Justinian entered a brothel and chose there two prostitutes, Antonina
and <i>Antonia</i>, sisters, whom they subsequently married. If this is not
merely loose hearsay emanating originally from a reader of Procopius, it
shows the sort of stories which were popularly current on the subject.

and became <i>sui juris</i>. About nine years earlier (<i>c.</i> 526, De Bel. Pers., i,

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
